 "RT @ndrewkellyborel: @JackPosobiec It's an absolute disgrace what they've done to @GenFlynn and his family.  This is one of the most highly respected men in America who was used and dragged through the mud by corrupt lawyers to get dirt and prop up a Hoax.   General Flynn should be fully exonerated."
