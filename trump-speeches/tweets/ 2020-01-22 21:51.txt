 "RT @GOP: “In less than 2 weeks the American people are going to head to the polls in IA to determine the outcome for the 2020 election &amp; this Democrat Congress is still trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election. That's not fair &amp; the American people are tired of it.” -@CMSmedile https://t.co/0HwidqU9hO"
