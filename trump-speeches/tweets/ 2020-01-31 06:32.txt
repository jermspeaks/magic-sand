 "RT @JaapTitulaer: @paulsperry_ Can't violate the Logan Act when you're working for the president or acting at his request.   Logan Act was created to block private citizens from acting as *if* they represented (the President of) the USA (foreign policy specifically).  Such as Kerry talking to Iran after 2016."
