 "RT @realDonaldTrump: The National Guard has been released in Minneapolis to do the job that the Democrat Mayor couldnâ€™t do. Should have been used 2 days ago &amp; there would not have been damage &amp; Police Headquarters would not have been taken over &amp; ruined. Great job by the National Guard. No games!"
