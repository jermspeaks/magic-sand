 "RT @Jim_Jordan: The “Whistleblower’s” lawyer called for a “coup” almost as soon as President Trump took office.  All the more reason why we need to hear from the individual who started this whole impeachment sham.  The “Whistleblower” should testify under oath and in person. https://t.co/oSwhWuXm3j"
