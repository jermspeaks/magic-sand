 "RT @JasonMillerinDC: Must be nice to have the MSM for a rapid response team.  No mention of Biden failing to call on Wheeler to allow federal help in Portland.  No mention of Biden refusing to condemn Antifa.  No mention of Dem Convention falling to condemn chaos &amp; criminals!  https://t.co/dr4EN2SuM6"
