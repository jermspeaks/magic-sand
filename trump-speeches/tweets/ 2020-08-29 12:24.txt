 "RT @BrandonStraka: I can’t even describe the sinking feeling I got last night being attacked for being gay &amp; just having to take it- bc if we defended ourselves the media would label us racist attackers. At least back in the day when gay bashing was common the media didn’t blame the gay ppl. https://t.co/wcXum5JqVu"
