Biden will bring back his war on American energy.Watch the Trump campaign's new video, "What We Don't Need"Under President Trump, the United States is leading the world in oil and natural gas production. Oil production has soared, surpassing records that stood for nearly half a century. America's energy industry is critical to supporting good paying jobs for workers across the country and President Trump is providing the support it needs to thrive.President Trump ended Joe Biden's war on American energy, unleashing our country's resources and withdrawing from the ineffective and burdensome Paris Climate Accord, saving American jobs. The Trump Administration has approved new pipelines and energy infrastructure to help our energy producers get their products to market â€“ which Biden has vowed to reverse.When the coronavirus hit our energy industry, President Trump took decisive action to help protect American workers and our vital energy producers. In contrast,Biden views the coronavirus as an "opportunity" to strangle American energy. As the president visits Texas, the Trump campaign is releasing a new video highlightingBiden's failed, old, liberal ideas: raising taxes on middle-class families, giving amnesty and taxpayer funded health care for illegal immigrants, banning fossil fuels, and sacrificing hundreds of thousands of American jobs.We don't need Joe Biden to transform our economy. We need Joe Biden to retire.
