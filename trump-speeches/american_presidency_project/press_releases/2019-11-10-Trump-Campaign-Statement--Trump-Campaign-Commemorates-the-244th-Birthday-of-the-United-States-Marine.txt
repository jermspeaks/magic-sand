Since then, United States Marines have fought in every climb and place across the globe â€“ protecting the cause of liberty. Marines embody the finest values of our country. They are a living example of honor, courage and commitment. The President's campaign wishes all Marines, young and old, the very best, and salutes their devotion and dedication to this great nation. Semper Fidelis, Marines."
