Biden said he'd "redirect" funding for police to other things.President Trump is right: Joe Biden said he would cut funding for police departments.Biden said he would "yes, absolutely!" redirect funding away from police to other government programs like housing.Kamala Harris recently said a Biden-Harris Administration would "reimagine" public safety, which is the same language used by left-wing "defund the police" activists.The Biden-Sanders unity platform's proposed destruction of qualified immunity for police would financially eviscerate local police departments even further.Joe Biden cut police funding when he was vice president despite promising to do the exact opposite:Despite Biden's promise in 2008 to fully fund the COPS program, the Obama-Biden Administration slashed COPS funding from $1.55 billion to $792 million.At the time, police groups protested the Obama-Biden cuts, calling the funding reductions "simply irresponsible."Federal aid to state and local law enforcement fell during the Obama-Biden Administration. Total federal grants to state and local governments from the Justice Department were cut by $833 million.Joe Biden broke his promise and cut police funding when he was vice president. If he's elected president, he will do it again.
