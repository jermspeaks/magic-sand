As Joe Biden and the radical left endorse policies that would dramatically slow our nation's economic recovery including tax hikes, burdensome regulations, and bad trade deals, President Trump is restoring jobs and rebuilding small businesses. Workers across America know that a Joe Biden presidency would be disastrous for their families and support President Trump's pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda. In aletterto President Trump, the President and Chair of the Associated Builders and Contractors endorsed his re-election and strong second term agenda:"Your continued support for fair and open competition, job creation, small businesses and expanded workforce development initiatives during your first term in office have helped ABC members grow their businesses, upskill their workforce and create career enhancing jobs. You and your administration have supported developing the workforce of the future by establishing the National Council for the American Worker, launching the Pledge to Americaâ€™s Workers, creating Opportunity Zones and signing the FIRST STEP Act, the most meaningful criminal justice reform in a generation. You are creating the conditions for all Americans to achieve their career goals."
