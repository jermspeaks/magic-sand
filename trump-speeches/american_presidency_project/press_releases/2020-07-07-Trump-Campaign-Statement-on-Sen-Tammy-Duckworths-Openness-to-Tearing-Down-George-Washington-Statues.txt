"After saying she was open to tearing down statues of George Washington, Tammy Duckworth is now using her military service to deflect from her support for the left-wing campaign to villainize America's founding. If she can't defend George Washington, our first Commander-in-Chief, those of us who still respect our Founding Fathers' immense sacrifice and think America is worth fighting for will hold her accountable for cowering to the far-left fascists in the Democrat Party."- Scott O'Grady, Veterans For Trump Co-Chair & Medal of Honor Recipient MG (R) Patrick Brady
