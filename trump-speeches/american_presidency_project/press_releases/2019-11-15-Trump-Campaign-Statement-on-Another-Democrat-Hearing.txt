"As both Adam Schiff and Marie Yovanovitch acknowledged, ambassadors serve at the pleasure of the President, who can dismiss them at any time for any reason, or no reason at all. Yovanovitch has no personal knowledge of anything the Democrats are using in their bogus quest for impeachment. This has been a complete waste of everyone's time and a disservice to the taxpayers."- Kayleigh McEnany, Trump campaign national press secretary
