Biden attempted to demonstrate that he does not need to take a cognitive test bybringing up a cocaine testand asking the reporter if he was a "junkie."2. Biden painfullyinvited Americans to judge himon his mental fitness.3. Biden let his racism show—again—bysuggesting that Black Americans are all the same.4.

Biden said he'dstop building the border wall, opening up our border for more illegal immigration, human trafficking, and deadly drugs.8. Bidendismissed blue-collar manufacturing and energy workersas "obsolete."9.
