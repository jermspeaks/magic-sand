Biden is nothing more than an empty vessel for his handlers and the radical left.Just like Ron Burgundy, Joe Biden willreadanythingoff the teleprompter. "Look, Venezuela topline message is..." Bidensaid last night during an interviewwith NBC Miami, embarrassingly reading verbatim the title of the talking points prepared for him by his handlers.It's the latest evidence that Biden regularly relies on scripts, even during TV interviews.Biden fumbled in a livestream conversation in May before instructing his staff offscreen to "put that back on," "keep it down," and then "go back to the top." He's been caughtwaving to staff off screento scroll the teleprompter, asking, "let me go to the second thing." He got caughtreading long-winded answersoff a script – his eyes and his cadence gave it away – in an interview with MSNBC. He evenneeded a scriptto invite Kamala Harris to be his vice president.The damaging optics ofBiden using written, paper notes during TV interviews–and his inability to make sense– must have been too much. No wonder Biden's handlers have stuck to a strict strategy of keeping him hidden away from reporters and voters for as long as they could.
