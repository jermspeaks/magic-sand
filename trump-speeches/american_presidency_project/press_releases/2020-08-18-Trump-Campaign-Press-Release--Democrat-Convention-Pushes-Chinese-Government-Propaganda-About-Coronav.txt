Joe Biden's praise for Andrew Cuomo destroys any credibility he pretended to have.From the start, the Chinese Communist Party has attempted to hide the true origins of the coronavirus.Last night, the Democrat Convention, Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Joe Biden joined the Chinese in spreading disinformation."The European virus infected the northeast while the White House was still fixated on China," said Governor Cuomo, whosemismanagement in New Yorkresulted in the highest number of deaths in the country.Biden praised Cuomo's remarkson Twitter immediately,No doubt Chinese officials were very happy too.They tried to pin the blame on Europe months ago,claimingtheir research showed "this virus came from Europe."Prior to that, Chinese officials tried blaming the U.S. military for the virus.President Trump countered China's disinformationby calling it the "Chinese virus" – a move Biden attacked, just ashe attacked President Trump's decisionto restrict travel from China on January 30."[T]here is no leader in the United States — or anywhere in the free world, for that matter — who did a worse job preserving life than the governor of New York,"writes National Review's David Harsanyi."Cuomo has long been a curious leader for Democrats to hold up as an emblem of successful leadership during the pandemic,"writes The Atlantic's Russell Berman. "Cuomo's initial response to the coronavirus outbreak wasslow and mistake-filled. He initially balked at issuing stay-at-home orders while cases mounted and then ordered sick elderly patients out of hospitals and back to nursing homes, where the virus spread like wildfire."Leadership matters, and Cuomo failed the test.That Biden would hold him up as an example is absurd, and his praise for such a massive failure should put an end to the myth that Biden has any credibility on the coronavirus.
