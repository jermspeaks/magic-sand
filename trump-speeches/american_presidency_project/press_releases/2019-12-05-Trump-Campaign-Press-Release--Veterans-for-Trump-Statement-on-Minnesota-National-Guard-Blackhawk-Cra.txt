"We should always remember the sacrifices that those who serve make in order to protect freedom. Every mission, at home or abroad, comes with risk; a risk that brave men and women stand ready to take on at a moment's notice. Our nation stands eternally grateful for the bravery and sacrifice of members of the Minnesota National Guard. Our prayers go out to their families and fellow guardsmen â€“ may the Lord keep them close during this time of great sorrow."-- Jeff Landry, Co-Chair of Veterans for Trump, former National Guardsman, and Louisiana Attorney General
