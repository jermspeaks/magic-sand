"Leading by example, President Trump has put the health and safety of the American people first with his decision on the Jacksonville convention. The President has built the most innovative political campaign in history and will provide exciting, informative, and enthusiastic programming so Republicans can celebrate the re-nomination of President Trump and Vice President Pence. We look forward to celebrating the historic achievements of the administration and exposing what Joe Biden is â€“ the empty vessel, Trojan Horse candidate used by the extreme left to advance their radical agenda."- Bill Stepien, Trump 2020 campaign manager
