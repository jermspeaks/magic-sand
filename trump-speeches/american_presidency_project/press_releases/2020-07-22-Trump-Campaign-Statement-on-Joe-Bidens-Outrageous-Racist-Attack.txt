"This is an insult to the intelligence of Black voters and is really rich coming from a guy who proudly befriended segregationists, touted an award from George Wallace, honored a former Exalted Cyclops of the Ku Klux Klan, worried his kids would grow up in a 'racial jungle,' marveled that Barack Obama was 'articulate' and 'clean,' bragged about being from a slave state, and repeatedly used the n-word."President Trump loves all people, works hard to empower all Americans, and is supported by more Black voters than any Republican presidential candidate in modern history. No one should take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden."- Katrina Pierson, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor
