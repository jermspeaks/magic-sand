"Americans can see that President Trump is out front and leading the country in the battle against the coronavirus. With his signing of the CARES Act, Americans will get the relief they need as they fight through this crisis. President Trump is both protecting the health and safety of our citizens and safeguarding our economy at the same time."- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
