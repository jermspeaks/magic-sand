"Nothing exposes Joe Biden's disdain for the forgotten working men and women of Pennsylvania like campaigning withanti-fracking activist Lady Gaga. This desperate effort to drum up enthusiasm for his lackluster candidacy is actually a sharp stick in the eye for 600,000 Pennsylvanians who work in the fracking industry. Biden repeatedly promised left-wing activists he would end fracking, which would be an economic death sentence and financial Armageddon for families in Pennsylvania and across the country. A big reason thePittsburgh Post-Gazette endorsed President Trumpis because he supports and defends American energy workers and is the best candidate to make our economy great again. Joe Biden will always prioritize the desires of the liberal Hollywood elite and the radical left, while President Trump will always put the interests of blue-collar workers first."- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
