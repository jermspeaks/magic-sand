At a'Cops for Trump' eventin Greensburg, Pennsylvania, Vice President Mike Pence reiterated President Trump's loyalty to the law enforcement community and condemned Joe Biden and the radical left for undermining the safety and security of our communities:"Some of the leading politicians in the Democratic Party today liken law enforcement officers to 'storm troopers.' I mean, even Joe Biden said not long ago that well-armed police 'become the enemy' when confronting lawlessness in our streets. Well I want to assure you, your president knows, this vice-president knows, and the overwhelming majority of the American people know that the men and women of law enforcement are the best people in this country. Law enforcement isn't the problem, law enforcement is the solution. That's why President Trump and our entire administration back the blue."This election offers a clear choice between President Trump, who is willing to stand up to crime and lawlessness, and Joe Biden, who has bowed down to the far-left and their demands to defund the police.CLICK HERE TO WATCHThe Vice President will also visit Guy Chemical Company to discuss the Trump Administration's pro-growth economic agenda.
