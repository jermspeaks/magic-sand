"The Biden campaign does not dispute the authenticity of the emails published by the New York Post, which serves to confirm that they are real. And if Joe Biden never met with Vadym Pozharskyi, the Biden campaign would say so. They do not say that. Their answer basically is that the entry 'Meeting with Ukrainian businessman buying access to the Vice President' does not appear on Joe Biden's official schedule. Their response is so carefully worded that it reveals the truth in what they don't deny. They also don't address the overarching question of why Joe Biden lied to the American people about never discussing with Hunter Biden his corrupt business dealings with the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Americans deserve a full accounting of the conversations Joe Biden had with Hunter, and what Joe Biden discussed with Vadym Pozharskyi."- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
