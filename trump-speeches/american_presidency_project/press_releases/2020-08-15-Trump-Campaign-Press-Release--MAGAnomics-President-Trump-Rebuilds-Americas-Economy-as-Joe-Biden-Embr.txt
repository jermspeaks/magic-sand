As President Trump mobilizes his entire administration to engineer the Great American Comeback and support job creation, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are proposing a disastrous far-left economic agenda that would raise taxes, stifle businesses, and stall economic growth. Joe Biden is no moderate, and he has endorsed the most radical overhaul of the American economy in history to mobilize his socialist base. Andy Puzder, former CEO of CKE Restaurants Holdings, and Betty and Jorge Rivas, Owners of Sammy's Mexican Grill, discussed all this and more in tonight's 'MAGAnomics,'hosted bySteve Cortes, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor.CLICK HERE TO WATCH"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris believe that big government, not small businesses, should drive economic growth, and they would completely undermine the American Dream if elected to the White House," saidSteve Cortes, Trump 2020 Senior Advisor."Only President Trump, with his deregulation, historic tax cuts, and America First trade deals, can reinvigorate our economy and bring back jobs.""After years of leading one of America's largest restaurant chains, I know that only President Trump's pro-growth economic agenda can achieve long-term success for American workers across the economic spectrum," saidAndy Puzder, former CEO of CKE Restaurants Holdings."While Joe Biden and Kamala Harris embrace job-killing socialist policies, President Trump is leading us to a Great American Comeback.""As small business owners, we have experienced the benefits of President Trump's winning economic agenda, and look forward to another four years of the Trump economy," saidBetty and Jorge Rivas, Owners of Sammy's Mexican Grill."A Joe Biden presidency would be a direct threat to our pursuit of the American Dream. Only President Trump can rebuild our economy, bigger and better than ever before."
