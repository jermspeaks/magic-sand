"President Trump's immigration policy just makes sense as the United States fights the war against the coronavirus. He has two main goals: to protect the health and safety of Americans and to safeguard the economy. This decision addresses both. At a time when our economy has been artificially interrupted by the virus, introducing more competition for jobs would worsen unemployment and depress wages, especially in Black and Latino communities. Preventing further entrance of people potentially infected with the virus is an additional safety measure for the country. President Trump always puts America first and a huge majority of Americans see this policy as common sense. The usual suspects are sniping from the sidelines, but they have always cared more about scoring political points against the President than they do about anything else."- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
