President Donald J. Trump has delivered more for the American people in 47 months than Joe Biden has in 47 years. From historic trade deals, to unprecedented tax cuts, to record-breaking economic growth, President Trump has continuously put America first and fulfilled his promises to the American people. Meanwhile, Joe Biden represents the failed status quo that has wreaked havoc on our communities for years and has now fully embraced the radical left's socialist agenda that will further harm hardworking men and women across the country. Today, President Trump reached 1,000 promises kept to the American people and will continue delivering groundbreaking success when reelected in November.Click Here to Read President Trump's Record of Promises Made, Promises Kept
