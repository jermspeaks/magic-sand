Biden will leave our border open to drug cartels, human traffickers, and illegal immigration.During Joe Biden's trainwreck interview where he said thatall Black people think alike, asked a Black reporter if he is a "junkie," andrambled unintelligibly, Bidendeclaredthere would "not be another foot of [border] wall constructed in my administration."Despite the need to stop deadly drugs, human trafficking, and illegal immigration, Biden plans to leave our border less than fully secure. He won't keep Americans safe.Biden'sdangerous policieswouldn't just impact Americans' safety, they would also allow illegal aliens to compete for American jobs as our economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. A year ago, Biden insisted that America could take in two million more immigrants in a "heartbeat." He'spledged to give health care to illegal alienswhile calling for more work permits and vastlyexpanded low-skilled immigration.In 2006, before Biden becamean empty vessel for the radical left, hesupported a border fenceto prevent "tons" of drugs pouring into our country.Now Biden wants to open our southern border, abolish immigration detention, stop all deportations, and support deadly sanctuary cities.President Trump is putting the safety and wellbeing of American citizens and legal immigrants first. U.S. Customs and Border Protection chief Mark Morgan confirmed this week that the Department of Homeland Security is "putting more wall system in place every single day than we have before." Up to 450 miles will be completed by the end of this year.Protecting Americans' physical and financial security is President Trump's number one priority.Biden's allegiance is to the radical, open borders left.One thing is certain: you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America.
