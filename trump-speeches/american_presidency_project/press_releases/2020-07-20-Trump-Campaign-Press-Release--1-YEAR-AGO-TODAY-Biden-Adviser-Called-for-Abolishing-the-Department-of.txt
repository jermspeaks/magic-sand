Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez now supports cutting police funding as well.One year ago today, socialist Biden adviser Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC)called for dismantling the U.S. Department of Homeland Securityand abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).AOC and her socialist Squad are on a quest to eradicate law and order in the United States, and now they're leadingJoe Biden's charge to cut police funding.He is too weak to stand up to their demands, sohe's joining them.In addition tocutting police funding, Biden has embraced many other priorities set by AOC:Bidensupportsending deportations of all illegal aliens,effectively instituting open borders.Bidenembracedthe radicalGreen New Deal, saying he'd happily sacrifice hundreds of thousands of blue-collar American jobs.Bidenwantsto makehardworking Americans pay for illegal aliens' healthcare.Bidenwantstoraisetaxeson middle-classAmerican families and workers.If you're wondering what Biden's America would look like after these radical policies are in place, look no further than Democrat-run citiesdescending into crime and chaos.While Biden bows to the far-left,President Trump isstanding up for law and orderand public safety for all citizens. Rather than demonizing and defunding the police, President Trumpknowsthat the vast majority of police officers are good people who put their lives on the line every time they put on their uniform to serve their communities and keep people safe.
