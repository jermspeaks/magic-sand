Citation: Donald J. Trump (1st Term), Trump Campaign Press Release - Kamala Harris is a California Radical who Completes the Left-Wing Takeover of Joe Biden Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/node/345730

With Kamala Harris by his side, the leftist takeover of Joe Biden is complete. Harris has embraced the Green New Deal, socialized medicine, and open borders, and all Americans should worry that she might be one heartbeat away from the presidency. Only President Trump and his administration can be trusted to rebuild our economy, defend our national security, and put America First.Team Trump hosted a press call with Representative Elise Stefanik (NY-21) and Stacy Washington, Black Voices for Trump Advisory Board Member, on Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' radical plan for America."What's very important about this vice presidential selection is not just how radical and far left this ticket is, it's also the fact that this is the new Democratic Party. This is not the Democratic Party of a decade ago or a generation ago. This is the party of Kamala Harris, of leftist politicians that are out of touch with hardworking Americans across this country who will determine who wins this election," saidRepresentative Elise Stefanik (NY-21)."Kamala Harris' career has never been about the people, it has always been about her â€“ and Joe Biden is no different. A Biden-Harris presidency will always put themselves first, and the American people last. Phony Kamala is Joe Biden's political living will, and her radical left beliefs should cause every American to worry about her being just one heartbeat away from becoming president," saidStacy Washington, Black Voices for Trump Advisory Board Member.
