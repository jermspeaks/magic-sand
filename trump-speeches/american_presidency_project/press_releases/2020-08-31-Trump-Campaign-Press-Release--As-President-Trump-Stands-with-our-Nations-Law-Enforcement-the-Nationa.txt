While Joe Biden and the radical left abandon our law enforcement officers, threaten to defund the police, and turn their backs on law and order, President Trump is giving unprecedented support to the men and women in blue. Law enforcement officers from across America are abandoning the Democrat Party, which has fully embraced the anti-police rioters and looters wreaking havoc in the streets. In aletterto President Trump, the National Troopers Coalition endorsed his re-election and law and order agenda:"During these uncertain times, your strong and unique leadership is necessary to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the communities we serve throughout the Untied States. We are grateful for your continued support for law and order and your unwavering stance against those who attack the very men and women that are willing to give their lives to protect others. It is that support which has resonated with our membership."- Jimmy Chavez, Chairman of the National Troopers Coalition
