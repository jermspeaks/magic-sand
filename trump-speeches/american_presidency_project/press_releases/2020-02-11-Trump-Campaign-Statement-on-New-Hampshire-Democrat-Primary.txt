"The Democrat story in New Hampshire is the continued dominance of big government socialist policies and the success of their standard bearer, Bernie Sanders. No matter which Democrat eventually emerges from their months-long dumpster fire of a primary process, we know the contrast will be President Trump's record of accomplishment and optimistic view of the future versus Democrats and their socialist, job-killing agenda."- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
