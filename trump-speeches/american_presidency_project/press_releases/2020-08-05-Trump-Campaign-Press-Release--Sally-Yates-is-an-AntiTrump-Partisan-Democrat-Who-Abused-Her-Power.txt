Now she's covering up Joe Biden's abuses.Former Obama-Biden Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates is testifying to the Senate about the previous administration'spolitically motivated targetingof the Trump campaign and transition, including thatJanuary 5, 2017, Oval Office meetingwith President Obama,Vice President Joe Biden, andSusan Rice.Biden has still not come cleanabout what he said in that meeting about the Logan Act, and conveniently, todayYates claimed she does not rememberwhat Biden said.Why is Yates covering for Biden?Because she's an anti-Trump, partisan Democrat.Yates endorsed Biden in March 2020 and participated in a fundraiser for his campaign.InNovember 2019, Biden said Yates could be his pick for vice president.Yates joined the anti-Trump resistanceas acting U.S. attorney general in January 2017, when she refused to defend in court a lawful policy decision by the president â€“ a decisionthe Supreme Court predictably ruled was wholly legitimate.AsBill Barr wrote at the time(as a former attorney general), "While an official is always free to resign if she does not agree with, or has doubts about, the legality of a presidential order,Yates had no authority and no conceivable justificationfor directing the department's lawyers not to advocate the president's position in court. Her action was unprecedented and must go down asa serious abuse of office."The fact that Biden would even consider for VP someone whoabused their power, damaged our democracy, and undermined the rule of lawshows just how destructive a Biden presidency would be to America's institutions.
