Biden sold out American workers for decades.Americansfinallyhave a President thatstands up for American workers. President Trump'sExecutive Ordertoday will help bring supply chains back to the United States and ensure we're producing essential medications in America rather than relying on foreign suppliers. This is a win for American workers and consumers.President Trump has worked to restore U.S. supply chains since his first day in office.He signed an executive order in theopening months of his presidencyto "assess and strengthen the manufacturing defense industrial base and supply chain resiliency of the United States," and last year President Trump publicly encouraged U.S. companiesto move their production capabilities out of Chinaand back to the United States. Due to President Trump's tough negotiations,many have already done it.President Trump's commitment to his America First agenda has already resulted in American companies bringingnearly $1 trillion back to the United States, and the Trump Administration has onlyturbochargedtheir efforts in response to the coronavirus pandemic.Joe Biden doesn't know anything about putting American workers first.His failed, old, liberal ideas will undo President Trump's progress andship jobs and supply chains overseas, just ashe did for decades. Hisglobalist agendahelped China bleed America's production capacity dry.As a result of NAFTA and China's "most favored nation" trade status, both supported by Biden,60,000 American factories closedand one in four manufacturing jobs were lost.President Trumpkept his promiseto put America first.Hardworking Americans won't let Joe Biden betray them again.
