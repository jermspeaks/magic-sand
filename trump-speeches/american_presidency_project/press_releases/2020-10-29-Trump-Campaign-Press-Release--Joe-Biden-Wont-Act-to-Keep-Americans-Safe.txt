Biden failed to destroy ISIS, opposed the raid to get Osama bin Laden, and said he would have let Iran's top terrorist continue to kill Americans.President Trump just left Fort Bragg in North Carolina, where he met with Army special operations forces and presented the presidential unit citation to our heroes who conducted the successful raid against ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi one year ago this week. The President and First Lady also visited the special forces memorial and paid their respects.President Trump's record of taking out dangerous terrorists and protecting American lives stands in stark contrast to the weakness of Joe Biden.Biden has repeatedly shown he lacks the judgement necessary to protect our national security and keep Americans safe at home and abroad:Biden opposed the raid against Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, admitting himself that he advised President Obama "don't go." Hedidn't have the gutsto do it, and then helied about it.On Vice President Joe Biden's watch,ISIS swept across the Middle Eastand wreaked terror around the world.When U.S. special forces had future ISIS leader al-Baghdadi in their crosshairs in 2011, they requested authorization to take him out. Under Vice President Joe Biden, an answer didn't come fortwo weeks. By then, it was too late and the opportunity had passed.Biden opposed President Trump's decision to eliminate Iran's top terrorist Qasem Soleimani, who had the blood of hundreds of American troops on his hands. Biden predicted eliminating Soleimani would cause a"major conflict across the Middle East."He was wrong.
