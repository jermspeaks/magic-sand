I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump."September 6, 2020: Kamala Harris says "I think that's going to be an issue" when asked if she would get an approved coronavirus vaccine.July 28, 2020: Joe Biden suggests the coronavirus vaccine won't be "real" and may not be "safe."August 6, 2020: Biden says the vaccine is "not likely to go through all the tests that needs to be and the trials that are needed to be done."September 3, 2020: Biden asks "Who's going to take the shot? Are you going to be the first one to say sign me up?"September 7, 2020: Biden said he would take the coronavirus vaccine "only if we knew all of what went into it."Comments like these, directly contradicting public health officials, have endangered Americans' public health byseverely undermining the public's confidencein the coronavirus vaccine.
