The APP has not assessed the accuracy of any claims made here either pro or con.]President Trump's re-election campaign today released two new ads featuring testimonials from Americans whose livelihoods are being threatened by Joe Biden's radical left-wing policies but have prospered under President Trump. One ad, titled "Janelle and Kelvin," features testimonial from a couple who condemn Joe Biden's history of racist policies and mass incarceration, while commending President Trump's strong economic leadership. The other ad, titled "Jen," highlights a Pennsylvania fracking technician whose industry has thrived under the Trump Administration and would be eliminated under Joe Biden's harsh regulatory agenda.These two ads are part of this week's eight-figure ad buy. "Janelle and Kelvin" will appear on local broadcast television in markets in Georgia and North Carolina, and "Jen" will air on local broadcast television in Western Pennsylvania.Click here to watch "Janelle and Kelvin"Click here to watch "Jen"
