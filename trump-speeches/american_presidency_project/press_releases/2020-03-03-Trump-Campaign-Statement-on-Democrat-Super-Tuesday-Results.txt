"The results only increase the likelihood that no candidate will have enough delegates for a first ballot victory at their convention, which only means more chaos! The media is hyperventilating about Joe Biden but everyone should remember that he is just as terrible a candidate right now as he was a few days ago. At the same time, establishment Democrats have ganged up to try to deny Bernie Sanders the nomination, which is causing even more mayhem. Even if Bernie is not on November's ballot, his big government socialist ideas will be because they have become mainstream in today's Democrat Party. President Trump will wipe the floor with whatever Democrat is unlucky enough to be the nominee."- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
