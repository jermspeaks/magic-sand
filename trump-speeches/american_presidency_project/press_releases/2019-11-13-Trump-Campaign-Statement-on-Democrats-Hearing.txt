"The entire world can read the transcript of President Trump's conversation with President Zelensky, so people don't need to rely on third-party opinions when they can see the facts for themselves. Despite that, today we heard from Democrats' hand-picked star witnesses, who together were not on the Ukraine phone call, did not speak directly to President Trump, got third-hand hearsay from one side of a different phone call in a restaurant, and formed opinions based on stories in the pages of the New York Times. We hate to break it to these unelected, career government bureaucrats who think they know best: the President of the United States sets foreign policy, not them. And disagreement on policy is not an impeachable offense."- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
