"Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., together with the RNC and Arizona State Party, moved to intervene in a significant ballot signature lawsuit in Arizona. Democrats are trying to remove safeguards for signature matching and unsigned ballots to create more opportunity for fraud. This filing represents yet another instance where the Trump Campaign is directly fighting to stop Democrat attempts to undermine election integrity and to protect the sanctity of the vote for citizens of Arizona and all Americans."- Jenna Ellis, Senior Legal Adviser to Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.Read the court filinghere.
