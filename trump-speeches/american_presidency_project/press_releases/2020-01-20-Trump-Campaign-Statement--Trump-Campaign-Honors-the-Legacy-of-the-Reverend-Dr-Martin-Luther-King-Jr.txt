In honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Katrina Pierson, Senior Advisor to Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., released the following statement."On this day, we remember and celebrate the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the champion of equality and dignity whose works and words transformed our nation and inspired the entire world. Fifty-six years ago, Dr. King stood before the Lincoln Memorial and spoke of his dream that one day all children will 'not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.' Today we rejoice that Dr. King's dream is being realized in so many ways, from record unemployment to families reuniting under the FIRST STEP Act, and we resolve for the African American community to rise ever higher to truly fulfill his dream."
