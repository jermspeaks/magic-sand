"We formally join Joe Biden's campaign in their call for the national news media, particularly cable and broadcast television outlets, to carry Biden's remarks and unscripted events in their entirety. The failure to expose the American people to these rambling displays of incoherence, ineptitude, and forgetfulness is depriving voters of a clear picture of Biden's inability to execute the duties of the office he seeks. Stop protecting Biden. Air the events."- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
