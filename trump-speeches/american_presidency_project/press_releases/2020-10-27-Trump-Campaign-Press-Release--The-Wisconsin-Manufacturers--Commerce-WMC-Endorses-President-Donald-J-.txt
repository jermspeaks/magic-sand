President Trump built the greatest economy in the world by passing historic tax cuts, slashing red tape, and negotiating America First trade deals, and only he can do it again. In contrast, Joe Biden threatens the Great American Comeback by embracing the socialist agenda of the radical left, including a $4 trillion tax hike and his version of the Green New Deal. The Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce - the largest business association in the state - todayendorsedPresident Trump's re-election in support of four more years of strong economic growth."Wisconsin is a state the makes and grows things.
