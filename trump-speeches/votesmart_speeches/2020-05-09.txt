THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. This is the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and we've had a very productive meeting. It's going to continue after you leave. But we've had a very, very productive meeting. Our military is very strong, more , more so than it's been in many, many years. I think I can say "in many, many decades." We've spent one and half trillion dollars rebuilding our military, and it shows it. And we are discussing various things. And, with that, thank you very much. Thank you. END
