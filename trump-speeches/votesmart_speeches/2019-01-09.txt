Title: Statement by the President
Date: 2019-01-09
Type: statement

Today, I have signed into law S. 1862, the "Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act" (the "Act"). Several provisions of the Act, including sections 6, 7, and 8, purport to dictate the position of the United States in foreign affairs and to direct certain diplomatic actions. My Administration will treat these provisions consistent with the President's exclusive constitutional authority as the sole representative of the United States in foreign affairs.
