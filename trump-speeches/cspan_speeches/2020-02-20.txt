THE SIXTH BRANCH OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES, THE SPACE FORCE. [APPLAUSE] I WILL BE MAKING A BIG DECISION FOR THE 'S AS TO WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE LOCATED. I KNOW YOU WANTED. [CHEERS] WE WILL MAKE THAT DECISION TOWARD THE END OF THE YEAR. I WAS UP AT THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY. THOSE KIDS WERE SO GREAT. I DID THE COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS.

I SAID, OTHER PEOPLE DO IT? YES, SIR. THEY DON'T DO 1156. THEY WILL TAKE THE TOP 10 OUT OF THE CLASS. I SAID, I'LL DO IT. I SIT THERE FOR 2.5 HOURS. [CHEERS] IT'S TRUE. [CHEERS] I SHOOK 1156 HANDS. [CHEERS] A LOT OF THESE KIDS ARE VERY STRONG, PHYSICALLY. [LAUGHTER] ONE OF THEM WAS THE WINNER OF THE HOME RUN DERBY. DID YOU KNOW THAT? THE COLLEGE HOME RUN DERBY. LET ME SEE YOU. I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE. I DID SOMETHING FOR AIR FORCE. I DID SOME BUT -- SOMETHING FOR ALL OF THE ACADEMIES. IF YOU WERE A GREAT ATHLETE AND THEY HAD A HARD TIME RECRUITING, YOU CAN'T -- WE WANTED TO GET THEM TO GO BUT THEY DIDN'T BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SERVE FIVE YEARS IN THE MILITARY AND GO TO THE NFL OR BASEBALL. I HAD ONE OF THE TEAMS IN. THEY SAID, GIVE US THE WAIVER. THEY HAVE BEEN AFTER THE WAIVER. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE WAIVER IS? IF YOU ARE A GREAT ATHLETE, YOU CAN GO TO THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY OR ARMY, NAVY, THE COAST GUARD, YOU CAN GO TO ONE OF OUR SERVICE ACADEMIES. WE GOT IT THROUGH CONGRESS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SERVE. YOU GO DIRECTLY INTO THE MAJOR LEAKS COME INTO THE NFL. YOU SERVE YOUR TIME AFTER YOU GET OUT. ISN'T THAT GREAT? [CHEERS] THE ARMY COACH IS A GREAT GUY. ALL GREAT GUYS. HE SAID, IF YOU DO THAT, WE CAN COMPETE WITH ANYBODY. WE LOST A LOT OF GREAT ATHLETES WHO SAID, WE CAN'T DO THAT. NOW THEY SERVE THEIR TIME AFTERWARDS. ISN'T THAT GREAT?

I'M TRYING TO ACT LIKE IT DOESN'T HURT. [LAUGHTER] BY THE END OF THE DAY, I'M GOING, -- BUT WE DID IT. I SAID, GENERAL, NO OTHER PRESIDENT COULD DO THAT. HE SAID, THEY STOPPED USUALLY AT AROUND 50. THAT'S GREAT. I LOVE THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY. YOU HAVE ALL OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU ARE BEING VERY STRONGLY CONSIDERED FOR THE SPACE FORCE. [CHEERS] I THINK I CAN SAY THIS. THE GOVERNOR SHOWED UP TODAY. YOUR GOVERNOR, DEMOCRAT. [BOOING] HE SHOWED UP. HE WANTED TO LOBBY TO SEE IF THEY COULD GET IT. THAT'S OK. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. WE ARE GOING TO BE MAKING THAT DECISION WHEN WE MAKE THAT DECISION. OK. WE DESTROYED THE ISIS TERRITORIAL CALIPHATE 100%. WE KILLED THE FOUNDER AND LEADER OF ISIS. HE'S DEAD. HE'S DEAD.

AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN LIKE NEVER BEFORE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AS WE KEEP ON WINNING, WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS KEEP ON LOSING THEIR MINDS. THEY'VE GONE NUTS. THAT'S WHY MILLIONS OF REGISTERED DEMOCRATS, VOTERS, PEOPLE THAT WERE WITH THE DEMOCRATS FOR A LONG TIME, THEY ARE LEAVING THEIR PARTY TO JOIN OUR MOVEMENT. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY ARE JOINING OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE HAVE MORE ENTHUSIASM THAN ANY PARTY IN THE LAST 50 YEARS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DON'T BELIEVE STORIES AND POLLS. THE POLLS ARE WORSE THAN THE STORIES. THEY GET PHONY POLLS. TWO WEEKS AGO. THE GREAT STATE OF TEXAS, THEY LOVE ME AND REMEMBER BEDDOE -- BETO? I WAS BORN FOR THIS. HE HAD PROBLEMS.

HE HAS BEEN SO GREAT. CORY GARDNER, PLEASE COME ON UP. THANK YOU. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. TRUE WITH THE PIPELINE. I HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR A LONG TIME. WE WILL BE ANNOUNCING VERY BIG FOR THE END OF THE YEAR. GLORIA IS A CHAMPION FOR THE PEOPLE OF COLORADO. HE LOVES YOUR STATE. HE DOES THE TRACTOR THING. HE LOVES TRACTORS. HE SELLS A CERTAIN TYPE. IF THERE'S ANY NOISE, LET THE PEOPLE HERE US. HE'S GOT MY COMPLETE AND TOTAL SUPPORT AND ENDORSEMENT. HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN. THAT WAS QUICK. THAT WAS QUICK. SHE GOES HOME TO MOM AND MOM LOVES US. HER MOTHER IS A BIG SUPPORTER. WAS THAT YOU WOULD YOUR BIG STADIUM? SHE WILL HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE AT HOME WITH MOM AND DAD. TOGETHER, WE ARE BUILDING THE WORLD'S MOST PROSPEROUS ECONOMY. WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST THREE YEARS THEY SAID WAS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO. WE'VE CREATED NEARLY 180,000 NEW JOBS RIGHT HERE IN COLORADO. NOBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT. INCLUDING 25,000 NEW MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION JOBS. REMEMBER. YOU CAN'T DO MANUFACTURING JOBS ANYMORE. REALLY? TELL ME ABOUT IT. UNEMPLOYMENT HAS REACHED THE LOWEST RATE IN OVER HALF A CENTURY. THE AVERAGE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, THIS IS A BEAUTY. FOR MY ADMINISTRATION, IT'S THE LOWEST FOR ANY UNITED STATES PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANIC AMERICANS, AND ASIAN-AMERICANS HAS REACHED THE LOWEST LEVELS EVER RECORDED. AND FOR WOMEN, 71 YEARS, SOON YOU WILL BE HITTING THE HISTORIC NUMBER. 71 YEARS, THE BEST NUMBERS IN 71 YEARS. AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC AMERICAN POVERTY HAS PLUMMETED TO THE LOWEST RATES EVER RECORDED. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR WOMEN IS GOING. I'M TELLING YOU, WITHIN A SHORT TIME, YOU WILL SEE STATISTICS COMING OUT. IF YOU GO 16 OF THESE COME IF YOU MISS PRONOUNCE ONE WORD, THEY SAY, WHAT'S WRONG? STATISTICS. STATISTICS FOR WOMEN THAT WILL BE UNBELIEVABLE. IT WILL BE UNBELIEVABLE. THE BEST EVER. THE VETERANS UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DROPPED TO A RECORD LOW. WORKERS WITHOUT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA HAVE ACHIEVED THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE EVER RECORDED IN U.S. HISTORY. HALF A MILLION MORE HISPANIC AMERICANS NOW OWN A HOME. WE'VE LIFTED 10 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF WELFARE AND MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS NOW AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. TO LIFT UP FORGOTTEN COMMUNITIES THAT NEED INVESTMENT THE MOST, WE CREATED WITH TIM SCOTT, GREAT GUY, GREAT SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA, OPPORTUNITIES, JOBS, INVESTMENT ARE NOW POURING IN TO OVER 125 NEWLY DESIGNATED OPPORTUNITY ZONES RIGHT HERE IN COLORADO. YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT, RIGHT? OPPORTUNITY ZONES ARE AMAZING. WE ARE SUPPORTING WORKING FAMILIES BY FIGHTING FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE AND GETTING IT. REDUCING THE COST OF CHILDCARE AND GIVING 40 MILLION AMERICAN FAMILIES AN AVERAGE OF $2200 IN THEIR POCKETS DIRECTLY THANKS TO THE REPUBLICAN CHILD TAX CREDIT. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT. OUR HISTORIC REGULATORY REDUCTION CAMPAIGN IS ENDING THE TIERNEY OF WASHINGTON BUREAUCRATS. WE REPEALED THE RIDICULOUS ORDERS OF THE UNITED STATES RULED WHICH WAS BASICALLY TAKING AWAY YOUR PROPERTY. WE ARE TAKING THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT OUT OF WASHINGTON, D.C., WE ARE JUST ON IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SECRETARY BERNHARDT. NICE, SLIM, BEAUTIFUL LOOKING MAN. HE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL. WHEN YOU WORK WITH HIM, HE IS BEAUTIFUL. HE GETS IT DONE. WE ARE MOVING ITS HEADQUARTERS TO GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT MANAGE THE LAND, THE GREAT AMERICAN WEST, SHOULD LIVE RIGHT HERE IN THE GREAT AMERICAN WEST. WE HAVE ENDED THE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY. THERE'S A WAR AND WE ARE UP. WE'RE DOING IT. WE ARE RIGHT HE -- RIGHT NOW ENERGY INDEPENDENT. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? THEY WANT TO USE WIND, WIND, WIND. LOW, WIND, PLEASE. PLEASE KEEP THE BIRDS AWAY FROM THE WINDMILLS, PLEASE. TELL THOSE BEAUTIFUL BALD EAGLES -- OH NO, A BALD EAGLE. IF YOU SHOOT A BALD EAGLE, THEY PUT YOU IN JAIL FOR A LONG TIME. THE WINDMILLS KNOCK THEM OUT LIKE CRAZY. IT'S TRUE. I THINK THEY HAVE A RULE. AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF KILLS, YOU HAVE TO CLOSE DOWN THE WINDMILL. DO YOU BELIEVE THIS? THEY ARE ALL MADE IN CHINA AND GERMANY. SIEMENS. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT WANT TO HEAR IT, MORE STUFF GOES UP INTO THE AIR AND UP INTO THE OZONE. THE ATMOSPHERE. MORE STUFF IS GOING UP THERE. THEY DON'T SAY THIS. AFTER A TIME, THEY GET OLD AND RUSTY. A LOT OF THE GUYS SAY, THEY ARE USEFUL. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. THEY ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. LOOK AT PALM SPRINGS, CALIFORNIA. THEY ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY ARE CLOSED, ROTTING, THEY LOOK LIKE HELL. EVERY MAJOR DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WANTS TO ENTIRELY ELIMINATE AMERICAN PRODUCTION OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS, CRUSHING COLORADO'S ECONOMY. DESTROYING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF COLORADO ENERGY JOBS AND DEMOLISHING PROPERTY VALUES ALL ACROSS THE STATE. THEY ARE DOING THAT. YOU WILL LOOK FOR ONE OF THESE PEOPLE, PROBABLY CRAZY BERNIE. HE SEEMS TO BE LEADING. MANY MIKE, I THOUGHT HE WOULD COME UP. HE CAN'T BECAUSE HE CAN'T DEBATE. HE WASN'T MEANT FOR THE CAMERA. WE AGREE? HE WAS NOT EXACTLY GREAT LAST NIGHT. NO, I THINK HE LOST LAST NIGHT. ONLY IN COLORADO COULD SOMEBODY SAY -- NO, IT LOOKS LIKE BERNIE. CRAZY BERNIE. CRAZY BERNIE IS NOT BIG INTO NATURAL GAS AND OIL. THE THINGS THAT KEEP OUR GREAT FACTORIES AND PLANTS GOING. RIGHT? COLORADO VOTERS WILL NEVER LET IT HAPPEN. WE ARE REVERSING DECADES OF CALAMITOUS TRADE POLICIES. AMERICA LOST ONE IN FOUR MANUFACTURING JOBS FOLLOWING THE TWIN DISASTERS OF NAFTA AND CHINA'S ENTRANCE INTO THE WTO. UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION, ALL OF THAT IS CHANGING. THE ERA OF ECONOMIC SURRENDER IS OVER, THANK YOU. LAST MONTH, WE ENDED THE NAFTA CATASTROPHE. I SIGNED THE BRAND-NEW U.S. MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT INTO LAW. INCREDIBLE DEAL. THE USMCA IS A GIGANTIC VICTORY FOR FARMERS, RANCHERS, AND MANUFACTURERS ALL ACROSS THE GREAT STATE OF COLORADO. ALSO, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING WE GOT THAT PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT -- IF YOU LOVE YOUR CHILDREN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY STATE TAXES ON YOUR BEAUTIFUL SMALL PART -- FARMS AND BUSINESSES. IF YOU LOVE YOUR CHILDREN, IF YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR CHILDREN, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU DON'T LOVE THEM, DON'T LEAVE THAT BEAUTIFUL FARM TO YOUR CHILDREN. GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE. THEY DON'T TREAT YOU WELL, DON'T LEAVE THEM ANYTHING. ARE YOU LISTENING, DONNIE? I ALSO TOOK -- IT'S TRUE. IT'S A BIG DEAL. FARMERS WERE LEAVING THEIR RANCHES AND FARMS AND SMALL BUSINESSES TO THEIR FAMILY. THEY WERE BEING ASSESSED AND VALUED MUCH HIGHER THAN IT WAS WORTH. YOU COULDN'T DO IT. YOUR KIDS WOULD BORROW A LOT OF MONEY. THEY WOULD END UP LOSING THEIR BUSINESS, THE FARM THAT WAS IN YOUR FAMILY FOR 150 YEARS. MAYBE THEY WILL NEVER BE YOU. MAYBE THEY CAN'T FARM LIKE YOU. MAYBE THEY ARE BETTER. THEY WOULD BORROW A LOT OF MONEY AND LOSE THE FARMS IN KNACKERED -- NUMBERS THAT ARE STAGGERING. WE GOT RID OF IT. NO MORE DEATH TAX.  I ALSO TOOK THE STRONGEST EVER ACTION TO CONFRONT CHINA'S MASSIVE THEFT OF AMERICAN JOBS. WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO US OVER THE YEARS, WE WERE LOSING 200 BILLION, NOT MILLION, BILLION. BILLION. 500 MILLION WOULD BE A LOT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 500 BILLION. OUR STRATEGY WORKED. WE PUT TARIFFS UP. 25% ON THE FIRST $250 BILLION. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS POURED INTO THE UNITED STATES. THEY DEVALUE THEIR CURRENCY. WE DIDN'T PAY FOR IT DESPITE THE FACT THAT THESE GUYS LIKE TO SAY THAT WE DID. CHINA CAME TO THE TABLE AND WE MADE A DEAL THAT IS GREAT FOR US AND HOPEFULLY GREAT FOR THEM.  LAST MONTH, WE SIGNED A GROUNDBREAKING TRADE AGREEMENT WITH CHINA THAT WILL DEFEND OUR WORKERS, PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND BOOST AMERICAN EXPORTS. $250 BILLION WORTH OF PURCHASES, $50 BILLION WORTH OF FARM, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCES. -- PURCHASES. THE MOST I EVER PURCHASED WAS 16 BILLION. YOU KNOW THAT STORY. 16 BILLION WAS THE MOST EVER. YOU KNOW, SECRETARY SONNY PERDUE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB. I SAID, MAKE IT 20. THEY AGREED ON 20. NOW WE ARE GETTING READY TO CLOSE THE DEAL. BIGGEST RADIAL EVER MADE. THE BIGGEST DEAL EVER MADE. WE ARE GETTING READY TO CLOSE THE DEAL BETWEEN THAT AND USMCA. WE ARE GETTING READY TO CLOSE IT. I GO OVER, WHAT YOU HAVE FOR THE FARMERS? I GAVE YOU A LOT OF MONEY. I GAVE YOU A LOT OF MONEY. 16,000,000,001 YEAR. 12 BILLION FROM THE OR BEFORE. I TOOK IT OUT OF THE TARIFFS. WE HAD A LOT LEFT OVER. I SAID, TELL ME, LET ME ASK YOU, WHAT WE HAVE? WHAT'S THE NUMBER? 20 BILLION. THEY WILL FOR -- PURCHASE 20 BILLION. I SAID, MAKE IT 50. WE WENT TO CHINA. THEY WERE GREAT. THEY HAVE 1.5 BILLION PEOPLE. A LOT OF BEATING TO DO. I SAID, DO ME A FAVOR. 20 BILLION. PURCHASE FROM OUR FARMERS. WOULD YOU MAKE IT 50? NO, NO, NO. THEY AGREED TO DO IT. I DON'T THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE IT. YOU BETTER BE ABLE TO MAKE IT. I DON'T WANT THE FARMERS COMING TO ME, SIR, I'M SORRY. WE CAN'T PRODUCE THAT MUCH. I SAID OUR FARMERS WILL FIND A WAY. THEY WILL BUY LARGER TRACTORS AND SOME EXTRA LAND. BUY A BIGGER TRACTOR OR SOMETHING. IT IS TRUE. I'VE HAD PEOPLE SAY, THEY CAN PRODUCE THAT MUCH. FORGET IT. THEY WILL. LOOK AT THEM. YOU ARE A FARMER. FIGURE THAT ONE OUT. MIKE BLOOMBERG SAID YOU WILL NEVER FIGURE IT OUT. LONG BEFORE HIM, YOU WILL FIGURE IT OUT. I KNOW THE FARMERS. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT. $50 BILLION. YOU HAVE WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS SELLING OUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IMMIGRATION, RIGHT? EVERY DAY, DEMOCRATS OPEN-DOOR POLICIES ARE HARMING AND KILLING INNOCENT LIVES. IN THIS REGION ALONE LAST YEAR, ICE OFFICERS ARRESTED OVER 2000 -- OUR ICE OFFICERS, THESE GUYS ARE TOUGH. OVER 2000 CRIMINAL ALIENS, MS 13 GANGS, THOUSANDS, THEY BRING THEM BACK THE WAY THEY CAME FROM. NOW THEIR COUNTRIES TAKE THEM BACK. THEY WERE TAKING THE BACK. THEY TAKE THEM BACK. CHARGED OR CONVICTED OF DANGEROUS OFFENSES INCLUDING ROBBERY, RAPE, AND MURDER. WE BRING THEM BACK AND IN SOME CASES WE DON'T WANT TO BRING THEM BACK. I DON'T WANT TO HOUSE THEM FOR THE NEXT 50 YEARS. WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE CHANCES EITHER. WE WILL BRING THEM BACK TO GUATEMALA, HONDURAS, EL SALVADOR , MEXICO. WE BRING THEM BACK. THEY DIDN'T USED TO TAKE THEM. THEY WOULD SAY, WE DON'T WANT THEM BACK. OK, WE WILL GIVE THEM OURSELVES. WE DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE. IN DENVER, AN ILLEGAL ALIEN WAS RECENTLY CHARGED WITH BRUTALLY STABBING A JUDGE MULTIPLE TIMES. ATTEMPTING TO MURDER HIM AND HIS -- IN HIS OWN HOME. THE ALIEN HAD BEEN ARRESTED 36 TIMES OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS. OTHER THAN THAT, HE WAS A FINE FELLOW. FOR CRIMES INCLUDING ASSAULT AND CHILD ABUSE, YET SOMEHOW THEY KEPT LETTING HIM GO. HE WAS STILL IN OUR COUNTRY. IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE NATION, RADICAL -- WE ARE WATCHING THEM VERY CLOSELY. LEFT-WING POLITICIANS ARE IMPOSING DEADLY SANCTUARY CITIES AND SANCTUARY STATES. POLICIES THAT COMPEL LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO RELEASE THESE ILLEGAL ALIENS STRAIGHT INTO YOUR BEAUTIFUL COMMUNITIES. LAST YEAR, COLORADO DEMOCRATS ENACTED A LAW DECLARING THIS ENTIRE STATE TO BE A SANCTUARY FOR DANGEROUS CRIMINAL ALIENS. AS A RESULT, OF STATE AND LOCAL CENTURY POLICIES, OFFICIALS EMBOLDENED A PREVIOUSLY DEPORTED CHILD MOLESTER INTO THE COMMUNITY. IN DENVER, OFFICIALS RELEASED A CRIMINAL ALIEN ARRESTED ON VALERIE -- FELONY DRUG CHARGES. NOW HE IS A VERY DANGEROUS MAN. WE JUST CAUGHT HIM PROTECTED MURDER. RIGHT HERE IN COLORADO SPRINGS, EL PASO COUNTY, OFFICIALS DEFIED THE REQUEST OF FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND RELEASED A CRIMINAL ALIEN ARRESTED FOR ROBBERY, ASSAULT, AND KIDNAPPING. THEY RELEASED HIM STRAIGHT INTO YOUR COMMUNITY. THESE ARE THE DEMOCRATS. THESE ARE YOUR DEMOCRATS. DEMOCRATS THINK THAT COLORADO SHOULD BE A HAVEN FOR MURDEROUS PREDATORS, KIDNAPPERS CAN, AND FELONS. THEY COME IN ILLEGALLY. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT COLORADO SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT CRIMINAL ALIENS. IF YOU WANT TO SHUT DOWN SANCTUARY CITIES, STOP SANCTUARY STATES, IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR LOVED ONES, YOU MUST VOTE FOR CORRIE. BUT FOR TRUMP. VOTE FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE'RE GETTING IT DONE.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS TO OUR TIRELESS EFFORTS TO SECURE THE BORDER, WE'VE REDUCED ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS FOR EIGHT STRAIGHT MONTHS IN A ROW. ILLEGAL CROSSINGS ARE DOWN 75% SINCE LAST SPRING. WE HAVE ENDED THE HORRIBLE PRACTICE OF CATCH AND RELEASE.  YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO? YOU CATCH THEM. WHERE DO YOU LIVE? THEY DON'T HAVE AN ADDRESS. GIVE US YOUR ADDRESS. MANY ARE CRIMINALS. MANY ARE VERY DANGEROUS CRIMINALS. SO THEY ARE SAYING, WE ARE BUILDING WALL. 122 MILES AS OF YESTERDAY. IT'S A SERIOUS WALL. DID YOU HEAR? TWO WEEKS AGO, A SMALL SECTION, TWICE THE SIZE OF THIS STAGE, WE WERE PUTTING IT UP AND THEY WERE POURING THE CONCRETE. IT'S MEXICO. IT'S VERY ROUGH TERRITORY. IT'S PARTIALLY DESERT. WE WERE IN A ROUGH AREA. VERY WINDY. WE HAD A TREMENDOUS AND AND WINDSTORM. SO WE HADN'T PUT IT IN. WE PUT IT IN. IT WAS JUST GETTING SET. WE GOT HIT WITH A TORNADO OF WIND. IT BLEW IT DOWN. THE FAKE NEWS SAID, TRAVIS WALL -- TRUMP'S WALL FELL DOWN.  AT LEAST WE HAVE A VOICE WHERE WE CAN EXPLAIN IT. WE LIFTED IT UP. WE HELD IT UP. WHEN THE STORM WENT BY, WE HAD IT SET. IT SET BEAUTIFULLY THE FOLLOWING DAY. THAT SUCKER WILL BE UP FOR MANY YEARS. CAN YOU IMAGINE? WHAT HAPPENED IN A CERTAIN AREA? WE ARE DOING A GREAT JOB IN NEW MEXICO. NEW MEXICO IS GOING TO BE A GREAT STATE FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.  AND ARIZONA. WHAT WE'RE DOING ON THE BORDER IN ARIZONA, THEY WANT US TO DO IT BADLY. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT? I THINK FALLS OVER BECAUSE THE CONCRETE WAS JUST POURED. IT FALLS OVER. THEY MAKE IT SOUND LIKE THE WALL FELL DOWN. THESE ARE VERY DISHONEST PEOPLE. YOU KNOW THAT. BORDER PATROL HAS SEIZED THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF DEADLY NARCOTICS OVER THE LAST YEAR EVER RECORDED. IT'S HORRIBLE WHAT'S HAPPENING. THE LARGEST AMOUNT EVER RECORDED. WE'VE DEPORTED RECORD NUMBERS OF GANG MEMBERS, ESPECIALLY THE MS 13 GANG MEMBERS. THERE ARE OTHERS THAT ARE JUST AS BAD. WE'VE DONE MORE TO SECURE THE BORDER THAN ANY ADMINISTRATION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THE BORDER IS GOING TO BE VERY SOON. WE WILL HAVE SOME TIME NEXT YEAR, OVER 500 MILES OF BEAUTIFUL, POWERFUL WALL BUILT. WASHINGTON DEMOCRATS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE EXTREME. TAKING CUES FROM CRAZY BERNIE SANDERS. 132 CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS HAVE SIGNED UP FOR BERNIE'S HEALTH CARE TAKEOVER THAT WOULD STRIP 180 MILLION AMERICANS OF THEIR GREAT PRIVATE COVERAGE THAT YOU WANT.  WHILE THE SOCIALIST DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO DESTROY AMERICAN HEALTH CARE AND TRYING TO DESTROY YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. THAT WILL HAPPEN WITH ME. MY ADMINISTRATION IS IS -- PROTECTING YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY, YOUR MEDICARE, AND IS FIGHTING TO GIVE YOU GREAT, GREAT HEALTH CARE. WE ARE DEFENDING YOUR RIGHT TO KEEP THE DOCTOR AND TO KEEP THE PLAN OF YOUR CHOICE. PRESIDENT OBAMA, 28 TIMES HE SAID, KEEP YOUR DOCTOR, KEEP YOUR PLAN. KEEP YOUR DOCTOR, KEEP YOUR PLAN. RIGHT? IT WAS A LIE. WE SHOULD IMPEACH HIM. WE SHOULD IMPEACH HIM. IMPEACH OBAMA. GET HIM OUT OF OFFICE. NO, NOBODY THOUGHT OF THAT. WE CAUGHT HIM IN A LIE 28 TIMES AT LEAST. NOBODY SAID, LET'S IMPEACH HIM. ONLY THESE MANIACS, CRAZY NANCY PELOSI. CRYING CHUCK SCHUMER. WHAT ABOUT LITTLE PENCIL MAC? PRES. TRUMP: GOT THE WORLD'S SMALLEST THAT -- SNACK. HE LIED ABOUT MY STATEMENT. HE DELIVERED IT BEFORE CONGRESS. HE MADE UP A STATEMENT. IT WAS TOTALLY FICTIONAL. THEY TELL ME, YOU ARE GETTING READY TO SUE HIM. NO, HE'S PROTECTED BECAUSE HE MADE THE STATEMENT IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS. THAT SHOULD BE WORSE. THAT SHOULD BE WORSE. LITTLE WISEGUY. WE ARE MAKING HEALTH CARE BETTER, MUCH CHEAPER WHILE PREMIUMS MORE THAN DOUBLE IN THE FIVE YEARS BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE. WE ARE OFFERING PLANS THAT ARE UP TO 60% LESS EXPENSIVE. THEY ARE BETTER. THERE ARE BETTER. WE ARE PROTECTING PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS AND WE ALWAYS WILL. WE ARE FIGHTING TO STOP THE PRIZE MEDICAL BUILDING. I IMPOSED PRICE TRANSPARENCY. THAT WILL BE BIGGER THAN HEALTH CARE IN A CERTAIN WAY. WATCH THE PRICES COME DOWN. WHEN PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW THEIR PRICES, THOSE SAME PRICES FALL VERY FAST. WE HAVE APPROVED A RECORD NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE NEW GENERIC DRUGS WHICH ARE JUST AS GOOD AS THE NAMEBRAND DRUGS BUT AT A TINY FRACTION OF THE COST. WE HAVE TOTALLY TRANSFORMED VETERANS HEALTH CARE INCLUDING GETTING THE LONG-SOUGHT V.A. CHOICE AND V.A. ACCOUNTABILITY. NOW IF OUR VETERANS HAVE TO WAIT ON LINE, THEY GO OUT TO A LOCAL DOCTOR. WE PAY THE BILL AND THEY ARE ALL SET. THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR SIX WEEKS.  RIGHT? HE'S AGREEING, RIGHT? YOU DON'T SEE THOSE STORIES. USED TO SEE ALL THESE HORRIBLE THAT STORIES. -- VET STORIES ON TELEVISION. VETERANS CHOICE IS AMAZING. HERE'S A MAN RIGHT HERE. YOU ARE SAYING, YES. RIGHT? PURPLE HEART. THANK YOU. THAT'S GREAT. IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT UNDER TRUMP, ISN'T IT? A LOT DIFFERENT. YOU GO OUT TO A PRIVATE DOCTOR. WE ALSO GOT ACCOUNTABILITY. THEY BEEN TRYING TO GET THESE THINGS DONE FOR 46 YEARS. I'M GOOD AT GETTING THINGS APPROVED. BUT WE ALSO GOT ACCOUNTABILITY WHERE WE CAN FIRE PEOPLE THAT AREN'T TAKING CARE OF OUR VETS. IF SOMEBODY IS DOING A BAD JOB, YOU COULDN'T FIRE THEM. NOW YOU SAY, GET THE HELL OUT OF. YOU'RE FIRED. WE PASSED ANOTHER THING. FOR 44 YEARS, THEY BEEN TRYING TO GET IT PASSED. THE RIGHT TO TRY. WE CAN USE OUR MEDICINES THAT ARE IN TRIAL IF SOMEBODY IS TERMINALLY ILL OR VERY SICK. WE ARE HAVING TREMENDOUS RESULTS. RIGHT TO TRY. I HOPE THAT NOBODY IN THIS ROOM NEEDS IT. I HOPE YOU DON'T NEED IT. IF YOU DO, WE HAVE THE BEST IN THE WORLD. WE ARE SEEING AMAZING RESULTS. WE ARE COMBATING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC, DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS HAVE DECLINED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY 31 YEARS. AND WE ARE PURSUING NEW ADVANCES IN NEONATAL RESEARCH TO CARE FOR AMERICA'S YOUNGEST PATIENTS AND BREAKING ALL RECORDS IN SO DOING. ALL OF THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS IN THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES HAVE DECLARED THEIR UNLIMITED SUPPORT FOR EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION, RIPPING BABIES RIGHT FROM THE MOTHER'S WOMB, RIGHT UP UNTIL THE VERY MOMENT OF BIRTH. YOU KNOW THAT.  THAT IS WHY AT MY STATE OF THE UNION, I ASKED CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT LATE-TERM ABORTION FOR BABIES. BECAUSE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD IS A SACRED GIFT FROM GOD. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS THE PARTY OF HIGH TAXES, HIGH CRIME, OPEN BORDERS, LATE-TERM ABORTION, SOCIALISM, BLATANT CORRUPTION, AND THE TOTAL OBLITERATION OF YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. THAT'S WHAT IT IS.  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER, THE AMERICAN FAMILY, THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND THE LATE GREAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN. PEOPLE FORGET THAT. PEOPLE FORGET HONEST A. HE'S THE MOST PRESIDENTIAL GUY, RIGHT? I'VE ALWAYS SAID, I COULD BE MORE PRESIDENTIAL THAN ANYBODY BUT I CAN'T BEAT HONEST ABE WHEN HE WEARS A HAT. THE HAT IS TOO MUCH. IT IS SO EASY TO BE PRESIDENTIAL. IT IS SO MUCH EASIER THAN DOING WHAT I HAVE TO DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE? ABOUT THREE PEOPLE IN THE FRONT ROW. WHAT ABOUT SLEEPY JOE? WHAT ABOUT HIS PERFORMANCE? IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH THE GREAT PEOPLE OF OHIO. JOE, JOE. YOU ARE IN IOWA. HE DID IT FIVE TIMES. SO FAR, I'VE NEVER DONE IT. IF I DO IT, THAT'S A BAD SIGN. HE DOES IT ALL THE TIME. HE WAS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND HE SAID HE WAS IN VERMONT. GREAT TO BE IN VERMONT. JOE, YOU ARE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. JOE, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU? SLEEPY JOE. HE'S SLEEPY JOE. HE WAS SLEEPY A LONG TIME AGO. NOW HE'S REALLY SLEEPY. IT'S EASY TO BE PRESIDENTIAL. YOU KNOW THAT. THE EASIEST THING YOU CAN DO. NEVER OPEN YOUR JACKET. NEVER. BUT NOT. -- BUTTON UP. RIGHT? THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S SO GREAT TO BE WITH THE PEOPLE OF COLORADO. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. GOOD NIGHT. IT'S SO EASY. IT IS SO EASY. HONESTLY. I DID VERY WELL WITH THE STATE OF THE UNION, RIGHT? THEY SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST. SMART. SMART. SMART. SMART GUY. WE DO GOOD. WE ARE REPRESENTING YOU. I BETTER DO GOOD. IF I DIDN'T DO GOOD, YOU WOULD THAT ME SO FAST. I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD, ACTUALLY. CNN WENT UP TO A WOMAN. WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR YOU TO LEAVE THE PRESIDENT? I'M NOT LEAVING HIM. THE ONE WOMAN, BEAUTIFUL. INCREDIBLE WOMEN. THEY HAD THEIR BANDANAS AND HATS. STUPID CNN GO UP, WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR YOU? LOOK AT ME HE SAID ONE TIME THAT IS PEOPLE ARE SO GOOD, THEY WOULD STAY WITH HIM IF HE SHOT SOMEBODY IN THE MIDDLE OF FIFTH AVENUE. YOU REMEMBER? WOULD YOU SAID -- STAY IF HE SHOT SOMEBODY? THIS IS ACTUALLY AN ANSWER. WOULD YOU STAY IF HE SHOT SOMEBODY IN THE MIDDLE OF FIFTH AVENUE? THE WOMAN LOOKS, IT DEPENDS WHY HE SHOT HIM. MAKES SENSE. DEPENDS WHY HE SHOT HIM. THEY SAID, WE ARE NOT LEAVING HIM. WE NEVER LEAVE HIM. WE ARE IN THIS THING TOGETHER, FOLKS. WE HAVE THE SWAP. WE HAVE THE DIRTY ROTTEN SWAMP. WE HAVE CROOKED POLITICIANS. A LOT OF BAD PEOPLE. WE ARE GETTING THEM OUT ONE BY ONE. WE BETTER BE. RIGHT? LITTLE ADAM SCHIFF. WHAT A CROOKED POLITICIAN. HE'S A CORRUPT POLITICIAN. TALKING ABOUT GUYS. HE WILL LIVE. THE NEXT A, HE WILL GET CAUGHT. HE WILL WALK UP TO THE MIC AND SAY EXACTLY THE SAME THING. HE HAS NO SHAME. NO SHAME. HE'S A LIAR. HE'S A SICK PERSON. REPUBLICANS ARE FIGHTING FOR THE CITIZENS FROM EVERY BACKGROUND, EVERY COMMUNITY, AND EVERY WALK OF LIFE. YOU KNOW THAT. WE ARE THE PARTY OF BOUNDLESS OPTIMISM, EXCITEMENT, ENERGY, AND ENTHUSIASM. WE ARE ASKING ALL AMERICANS TO JOIN OUR INCREDIBLE MOVEMENT. WE ARE THE BIG TENT. WE ARE THE BIG PARTY. WE HAVE THE BIG IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE. REPUBLICANS ARE FIGHTING FOR SCHOOL CHOICE, BIG DEAL. IT'S A BIG DEAL.  NO PARENT SHOULD EVER BE FORCED TO SEND THEIR CHILD TO A FAILING GOVERNMENT SCHOOL. TO UPHOLD THE NEW RULE OF LAW. WE HAVE CONFIRMED 217 BRAND-NEW, BEAUTIFUL FEDERAL JUDGES WHO WILL INTERPRET THE CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN. THAT'S A RECORD. IT INCLUDES 192 JUDGES WHO ARE APPOINTED FOR A LIFETIME. THINK OF IT. IF THEY ARE 40 YEARS OLD, 45 YEARS OLD, THEY COULD BE THERE FOR 50 YEARS.  AS YOU KNOW, THAT'S A RECORD. BY A LOT. I HAVE THE RECORD. THERE'S ONE RECORD THAT PROBABLY NOBODY WILL GET. THE PERCENTAGE RECORD. WHO HAS THE PERCENTAGE? DO YOU KNOW? GEORGE WASHINGTON, 100%. IT WAS ONLY 16 PEOPLE. WE ARE 217. IT'S A RECORD. WE ARE GOING UP. THE DEMOCRATS ARE THRILLED ABOUT THAT ONE. AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE NOMINATED AND WE HAVE CONFIRMED GREAT NEW SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. COLORADO ZONE -- COLORADO'S OWN. THAT'S RIGHT. NEIL GORSUCH. BRETT KAVANAUGH. NEAR GORSUCH. THAT'S RIGHT. HE'S A GREAT GUY. GREAT GUY. COLORADO, THAT'S A BIG THING. THAT'S ANOTHER GREAT CHECK YOU HAVE DOWN. NEIL GORSUCH. I RECOGNIZED ISRAEL'S TRUE CAPITAL AND OPENED THE AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. THEY SAID WE WOULDN'T DO IT. WE RECOGNIZED ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE GOLAN HEIGHTS. OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES MILITARY INCLUDE MORE THAN $300 MILLION THIS YEAR. HAS ANYBODY HEARD OF A PLACE CALLED FORT CARSON? ANOTHER PLACE. PETERSON AIR FORCE BASE. YOU KNOW THAT. ANOTHER PLACE. THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY. YOU KNOW THAT. AND SHREVE ARE. AIR FORCE BASE. WAS THAT RIGHT? THAT'S A TRICKY ONE. TOOK ME A LITTLE WHILE. THANK YOU. THAT'S VERY NICE. HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH THAT ONE. THAT'S TRICKY. YOU DON'T LIKE TO MISPRONOUNCE WORDS. YOU COME TO A GREAT PLACE LIKE THIS. INSTEAD OF CALLING IT FOR CARSON, YOU CALL IT FOR CRESTON. THEY SAY, THIS GUY DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT US. A LOT OF MONEY GOING INTO FORT CARSON. FOR YEARS, YOU WATCHED AS YOUR POLITICIANS APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICA. YOU SAW THAT. WE DON'T APOLOGIZE. NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS STANDING UP FOR AMERICA. WE'RE STANDING UP FOR THE GREAT PEOPLE OF COLORADO. AT STAKE IN OUR PRESENT BATTLE IS THE SURVIVAL OF OUR NATION. IF YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO INHERIT THE BLESSINGS THAT GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE FOUGHT AND DIED FOR, THEY WANTED TO SUGAR THESE GREAT RATES THAT WE ALL HAVE. WE MUST AVOID EVERYTHING WE HAVE TOWARDS VICTORY IN NOVEMBER OF 2020. ONLY THIS WAY CAN WE SAY -- SAVE THE AMERICA WE LOVE AND DRAIN THE WASHINGTON SPOT -- SWAMP ONCE AND FOR ALL. WE WILL GET IT FINISHED. THAT PEOPLE ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. WITH YOUR HELP, WE WILL LIFT OUR CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK AND POVERTY TO PROSPERITY. RIGHT? TOGETHER, WE WILL ELECT A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS TO CREATE A FAIR, SAFE, AND LAWFUL SYSTEM OF IMMIGRATION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENACT GREAT NEW TRADE DEALS. I AM GOING TO INDIA NEXT WEEK AND WE ARE TALKING TRADE. THEY HAVE BEEN HITTING US HARD FOR MANY YEARS, BUT I REALLY LIKE PRIME MINISTER MODI. WE HAVE GOT TO TALK A LITTLE BUSINESS. . THEY GIVE US ONE OF THE TARIFFS -- THEY GIVE US TARIFFS, ONE OF THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD. BUT ANYWHERE FROM 6-10,000,000 PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SHOWING UP AT THE LARGEST STADIUM IN THE WORLD, WHICH IS BRAND-NEW AND BEAUTIFUL. THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH DOING THAT, MODI SAID, WE WILL HAVE 10 MILLION PEOPLE. WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO CANNOT GET IN. GOING TO LOOK LIKE PEANUTS FROM NOW ON. HOW CAN WE BE SATISFIED IF WE FILL OF A 60,000 STEET STADIUM? I WILL BE GETTING SPOILED. HE SAID, BUILD A BIGGER STADIUM. THAT'S A GOOD ONE. WILL RESULT IN OUR PRODUCTS STAMPED WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL PHRASE, MADE IN THE USA. WE WILL ACHIEVE NEW BREAKTHROUGHS IN SCIENCE AND MEDICINE, FINDING NEW CURES FOR CHILDHOOD CARE AND ENDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA. , BUT WE WILL HAVE IT DONE IN NINE YEARS. THINK OF THAT. WE WILL LAND THE FIRST WOMAN ON THE MOON AND BECOME THE FIRST NATION IN THE WORLD TO PLANT OUR FLAG ON MARS. AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF THAT ACTION HAPPENING RIGHT HERE. WE WILL DEFEND PRIVACY, FREE SPEECH, RELIGIOUS LIBERTY, AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS. ABOVE ALL, WE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THE SACRED VALUES THAT BIND US TOGETHER AS ONE BEAUTIFUL AMERICA. WE SUPPORT, PROTECT, AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES. WE STAND WITH THE INCREDIBLE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE BELIEVE IN THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE SANCTITY OF LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT FAITH AND FAMILY , NOT GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY, ARE THE TRUE AMERICAN WAY. WE BELIEVE CHILDREN SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY, HONOR OUR HISTORY, AND ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT AMERICAN FLAG. AND WE LIVED BY THE WORDS OF OUR NATIONAL MOTTO. IN GOD WE TRUST. FROM PUEBLO TO FORT COLLINS, FROM DENVER TO DURANGO. FROM BLACK FOREST TO BROOMFIELD, FROM CANTOR ROCK TO RIGHT HERE IN COLORADO SPRINGS. WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF RED-BLOODED AMERICAN PATRIOT WHO POURED OUT THERE HURT, SWEAT, AND SOUL TO SECURE OUR LIBERTY AND DEFEND OUR FREEDOM. COLORADO WAS FOUNDED BY PROSPECTORS, COWBOYS, AND RANGERS WHO EXPLORED THE WILDERNESS, SCALED THE ROCKIES, AND HELPED MAKE THIS THE GREATEST NATION TO EVER EXIST ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH. WE ARE MAKING IT GREATER EVERY SINGLE DAY, GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE. PROUD CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY, AND TOGETHER, WE ARE TAKING BACK OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE RETURNING POWER TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH YOUR HELP, DEVOTION, AND DRIVE. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP ON WORKING, FIGHTING, AND WINNING ABOUT WINNING, WINNING. WE ARE ONE MOVEMENT, ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY, AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER GOD. AMERICA IS THRIVING LIKE NEVER BEFORE, AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN COLORADO, THE BEST IS YET TO COME. TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA PROUD AGAIN. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. THANK YOU, PEOPLE OF COLORADO.
