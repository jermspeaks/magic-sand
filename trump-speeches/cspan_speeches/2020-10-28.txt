[CROWD BOOING] IT'S A POWERFUL PARTY AND THE PARTY IS JOINED WITH THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA RIGHT THERE. THEY ARE TOTALLY JOINED WITH BIG TEX. SECTION 230, DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THAT IS? SECTION 230. TREMENDOUS CORRUPTION ON BEHALF OF THE BIDEN , YOU CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE IN THE MEDIA OTHER THAN THE NEW YORK POST. THEY ENDORSED ME THE OTHER DAY. [CHEERING] BUT YOU CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE IN THE MEDIA, ANYWHERE. IT'S NOT ON FACEBOOK. IT WOULD BE TRENDING. TO GIVE YOU 25 THINGS I'VE DONE OVER MY LIFE AND MAKE IT NEGATIVE. ALWAYS NEGATIVE TRENDING. BUT SLEEPY JOE BIDEN, WITH ALL THE CORRUPTION AND THE MONEY THEY TOOK OUT OF THESE COUNTRIES THAT WE END UP PAYING FOR, YOU CAN'T BUY UNDER BIG TECH AND YOU CAN'T FIND IT ON THE WASHINGTON POST OR NEW YORK TIMES BECAUSE THEY ARE CROOKED, DISHONEST AND WE CAUGHT THEM. WE CAUGHT THEM JUST LIKE WE CAUGHT THEM SPYING ON OUR CAMPAIGN. [CHEERING] JUST LIKE WE CALL THEM SPYING ON OUR CAMPAIGN. [CHEERING] WE CAUGHT THEM SPYING. [CHEERING] [CHEERING] A VOTE FOR BIDEN IS ABOUT FOR THE BIGGEST TAX HIKE IN THE COUNTRY. THE ONLY GUY I'VE EVER SEEN, HE'S CAMPAIGNING BECAUSE HE HAS NO CLUE. I'LL SAY IT, BECAUSE I SAID HEY, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH. THERE'S A GUY WHO GETS CAUGHT AND THE MEDIA DOESN'T WANT TO WRITE ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL IT? IT'S NOT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, DEPRESSION OF THE PRESS. WE DON'T HAVE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? WE DON'T HAVE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, WE HAVE DEPRESSION OF THE PRESS AND THERE'S NEVER BEEN A TIME WHEN IT MORE OBVIOUS THAN RIGHT NOW. IS THAT RIGHT? [CHEERING] BY THE WAY, HE DOESN'T WANT THAT. HE HAS NO IDEA WHERE HE IS. THEY CARRIED HIM OFF THE STAGE YESTERDAY. GIVE ME A BREAK. YOU WILL GRAB HIM, GET HIM OFF. GET HIM OFF. HE SIGNED TO MAKE IT TO THE FINISH LINE. I MEAN, HONESTLY, IT IS A DISGRACE. THE WHOLE THING IS A A CON JOB. THEY HAVE A CORRUPT PARTY IN ALL OF THIS WORK BEING DONE BY BIG TECH AND THE MEDIA, THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A MAJOR MASSIVE BILLION DOLLAR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS. THEY HAVE BETTER CARE WITH SOCIAL SECURITY, YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY AND HE WANTS TO ABOLISH A THING CALLED AMERICAN ENERGY. YOU SEE THAT. [CROWD BOOING] NO FRACKING. HE GETS THE NOMINATION AND GOES TO PENNSYLVANIA. JOE, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE. OKAY, WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY? I LOVE FRACKING. SAY I LOVE IT. SO HE SAYS I LOVE FRACKING. ABOUT FOR SLEEPY JOE IS ABOUT FOR OPEN BORDERS. SHREDDING YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT, WHICH IS TOTALLY UNDER SIEGE, BY THE WAY. [CROWD BOOING] YOU ARE SO LUCKY I AM YOUR PRESIDENT. [CHEERING] [CHEERING] [CHANTING] USA! [CHANTING] THANK YOU. WHAT A NICE GROUP. BY THE WAY, WE ARE SUBSTANTIALLY UP IN A STATE KNOWN AS ARIZONA. [CHEERING] AND I HEAR WE ARE UP IN NEVADA. IS THAT RIGHT? [CHEERING] WE ARE A LITTLE CONCERNED WITH THE BALLOTS FLOATING AROUND. A LOT OF BALLOTS FLOATING AROUND AROUND. IT IS WINDY AS , OUT HERE. I SAID IS IT WINDY? SHOULD I BRING A HAT? [CHEERING] I DON'T LOVE MY HAIR FLOPPING AROUND. AT LEAST I FIGURED OUT AFTER THREE YEARS, IT IS FINE. IF IT WASN'T, I WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT TODAY. YOU KNOW, SHOULD I PUT ON A HAT? [CHEERING] NICE HAT. I WANT TO KNOW, HAS WORN THIS HAPPY FOR? [CHEERING] AM I ALLOWED TO DO IT? I'LL DO IT IF YOU WANT. OTHERWISE , [CHEERING] [CHEERING] WHAT A GUY. BETTER? NICE HAT. YOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE HAT. WE'VE CREATED THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. THEN WE HAD THE PLAGUE COME FROM CHINA AND NOW WE ARE DOING IT AGAIN. BIZARRE UNBELIEVABLE. BY THE WAY, YOU WILL HAVE A VERY BIG NUMBER. A LOT OF YOU WANT TO WAIT ANYWAY ANYWAY. IT WILL BE A GREAT, GREAT, RED WAVE. [CHEERING] BEFORE THAT HAPPENED, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT THE ATLANTA PREDICTED A VERY BIG NUMBER, BIGGEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. IT'S GOING TO BE ANNOUNCED PROBABLY ON THE FIRST, MAYBE A DAY BEFORE THE FIRST. IF THE NUMBER IS NOT BIG, YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO VOTE. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE MAYBE THE BIGGEST NUMBER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. GGP. THAT IS OUR BIG NUMBER. I'M TAKING A CHANCE WHEN I SAY YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO VOTE FOR ME. WHO HERE IS VOTING FOR TRUMP? [CHEERING] THANK YOU. [CHEERING] THANK YOU. [CHEERING] ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOOD. ARE YOU WAITING UNTIL TUESDAY? [CHEERING] IS ANYBODY SENDING IN ABOUT IT? OR YOU DOING IT THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY? [CHEERING] I JUST DID THAT. WHATEVER YOU DO, YOU HAVE TO VOTE. WHO IS GOING TO VOTE FOR SLEEPY JOE BIDEN? [CROWD BOOING] I HAD LEADER OF THE COUNTRY CALL UP, TOUGH LEADER. THEY WOULDN'T, IF IT'S GOOD, THEY WOULDN'T REPORTED. HE SAID I HOPE BIDEN DOESN'T WIN BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS FLIPPING. A KILLER. I HOPE HE DOESN'T WIN BECAUSE HE'S SLEEPY. I SAID YOU HAPPENED TO BE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. THIS ELECTION IS A CHOICE BETWEEN A TRUMP SUPER RECOVERY AND BIDEN DEPRESSION. YOU WILL HAVE A DEPRESSION, LIKE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE. MAYBE 1929. WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES, BUT REGULATION BACK ON AND REMEMBER THIS, GET RID OF YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. REMEMBER THIS. [CROWD BOOING] PRO-LIFE, ANYBODY PRO-LIFE? [CHEERING] THIS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST ELECTION, IN MY OPINION, AND I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY IT, IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. [CHEERING] THE BIGGEST IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN TRUMP AND BIDEN LOCKDOWN. YOU CLOSE IT UP. IT'S REALLY SOMETHING. WE TALK ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM DREAM, YOU HAVE THE AMERICAN DREAM, IT WAS ALL TOGETHER. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, HE'S GETTING CALLED FOR PEOPLE, YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THEN WE HAD A MAN THAT CAME IN, WE WENT BACK TO WORK SAVED 2 MILLION PEOPLE, 2.2 MILLION PEOPLE, MAYBE MORE THAN THAT. IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN THE AMERICAN DREAM AND A SOCIALIST NIGHTMARE, THAT IS WHAT IT IS. THE REASON IT'S SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY MANY TIMES, OUR COUNTRY WILL NEVER BE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. [CHEERING] THAT'S WHY THEY WANT IT BACK. I'M FIGHTING FOR THE DREAMS OF ALL AMERICANS INCLUDING MILLIONS OF TRULY AMAZING HISPANIC AMERICANS. [CHEERING] WHOSE HISPANIC? [CHEERING] OTHERS ARE SHOCKED, THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT. THEY ARE REPORTING ON IT, I SAID I'VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM. I ALWAYS LIKED HISPANICS BUT THEY ARE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND ME. THEY'VE MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS SO THE POLLS FOR HISPANIC AMERICANS ARE THE HIGHEST EVER IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY, REPUBLICAN BUT IT COULD BE THAT WE ARE GOING TO STOP, TOP THEM. ONCE WE TOP THEM, FORGET ABOUT IT. WE'VE REALLY GOT THE BALL. BY THE WAY, WHO SOUGHT THE DEBATE THE OTHER DAY? [CHEERING] NINETY-ONE , NINE. I DON'T KNOW THE RULES. THAT'S NOT BAD. [CHEERING] I GET ANGRY AT THE MEDIA. HE ADMITTED RIGHT AT THE END, I SAID DOES THAT MEAN YOU DON'T LIKE IT, JOE? WELL, IT'S AMAZING. YOU HAVE A WATCH? HOW ABOUT COLOMBO? RIGHT AT THE END. THEY'VE BEEN WORKING FIVE DAYS AND THEN THEY HAD TO GO TO PENNSYLVANIA WHERE FRACKING IS A BIG DEAL. HOW ABOUT TEXAS? YOU THINK THEY LIKE HIM IN TEXAS? NO GUNS, SECOND AMENDMENT. NO RELIGION. THEN I HEAR, TRUMP HAS A ONE POINT LEAD IN TEXAS. I DON'T THINK SO. I USED TO HEAR THIS FOUR YEARS AGO ALL THE TIME. HE CANNOT WIN THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO. HE WON BY EIGHT POINTS. [CHEERING] TRUMP HAS NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE, HE CANNOT WIN TEXAS UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES. HE CANNOT WIN TEXAS. HE WON BY I DON'T KNOW, A LOT. I DON'T KNOW. REMEMBER THE GUY FROM UTAH? IS A SPECIALIST IN UTAH, HE WOULD WIN UTAH. EVEN HILLARY, CROOKED HILLARY BE THAT GUY. NICE SHAVED HEAD, NICE GUY. REMEMBER HIS NAME? I REMEMBER HIS NAME. ANOTHER RHINO. [CHANTING] I DIDN'T START IT. [CHANTING] I'M AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER. EVERY TIME, HE STARTED IT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MENTION THEIR NAME. DISGRACEFUL, DEPLORABLE. HE REDEEMABLE. THEY SAID DEPLORABLE, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER SPEECH WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE, SHE CAME OUT AND SAID GLOBAL BUT SHE ALSO SAID YOU REDEEMABLE. TO SHOW YOU WHAT I KNOW, SHE USED THAT WORD, HOW TERRIBLE IT WAS DEPLORABLE BUT WHOEVER HER SPEECH WRITER IS, I DON'T WANT HIM OR HER. THAT WAS A DISASTER BUT I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THAT BAD. THE NEXT DAY I SHOWED UP AT A RALLY, EVERYBODY SAID I AM A DEPLORABLE. OH BOY. SHE WAS A LOT SMARTER THAN SLEEPY JOE BUT THEY'VE GOT A LITTLE DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON. THEY ARE MORE DESPERATE. THEY ARE TOTALLY DESPERATE. LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES, COMING OFF THE STAGE YESTERDAY, HE SAW THAT HE CALLED ME GEORGE. HE THOUGHT I WAS GEORGE. HE CALLED ME GEORGE. [LAUGHTER] UNBELIEVABLE. I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS HAPPY OR IF I WASN'T BECAUSE HE CALLED ME , YOU KNOW, HIS WIFE WAS STANDING NEXT TO HIM AND SHE'S LOOKING LIKE, YOU COULD SHE WAS UNDER GREAT, GREAT STRESS. FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS, THESE SUCKERS ARE MOVING. ISN'T IT NICE TO HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T NEED A TELEPROMPTER? [CHEERING] [CHEERING] THEY ARE MOVING LIKE CRAZY. THEY ARE MOVING LIKE CRAZY. THAT'S OKAY WITH ME. [CHANTING] WE WANT TRUMP EXCAVATION.! WE WANT TRUMP! [CHANTING] AND I LOVE YOU. I DO. [CHEERING] THAT'S THE PHRASE, AND THEY SAY IT, NOBODY'S EVER HEARD, WE ALL LIKED RONALD RAGAN BUT NOBODY EVER SAID WE LOVE YOU, WE LOVE YOU. YOU WOULDN'T GET CROWDS LIKE THIS. IF RONALD REAGAN, WHO I CONSIDERED TO BE TOP-NOTCH, IF HE CAME HERE, HE'D HAVE A COUPLE HUNDRED PEOPLE, LEGITIMATELY. HE WOULD GO TO A BALLROOM AND THEY WOULD BE TWO OR 300 PEOPLE. THAT'S THE STANDARD. TWENTY-FIVE, 30, 35000 PEOPLE. [CHEERING] AT LEAST SOME OF THESE CROWDS, WE WERE PACKED IN FLORIDA AND ALL THESE PLACES. AT LEAST SOME OF THE CROWDS, LOOK AT THEM, YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE END. IF THEY WERE LEGITIMATE, THEY DIDN'T SHOW IT ON. THEY NEVER SHOW IT ON CAMERA. [CHEERING] THEY NEVER SHOW IT. THEY DON'T LIKE TO SHOW IT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO SHOW? BARACK OBAMA YESTERDAY, THEY MADE THE MISTAKE, THE CAMERA SLIPPED AND THEY SHOWED HIS CROWD, ABOUT 20 PEOPLE THERE APPROXIMATELY. WHICH WAS ABOUT TEN PEOPLE MORE THAN SLEEPY JOE HAD YESTERDAY. [LAUGHTER] WE WERE IN PENNSYLVANIA, YOU SAW THAT. WE HAD THREE RALLIES, IT WAS INCREDIBLE. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. JOE WAS IN HIS BASEMENT AND YOU THOUGHT. HIS HAND, THEY SAY SLEEPY JOE, WE HAVE TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE. WE GOT TO MOVE YOU. HE'S NOT LOOKING GOOD. THEY PUT A LID ON. A LID FOR GARBAGE CANS. [LAUGHTER] THEY PUT A LID ON. HE HAD THE LEAD AGAIN TODAY. HE HAS A LID EVERY DAY. THEN HE SAID, HE DOESN'T WANT BIG CROWDS. REALLY? BECAUSE OF COVID. HE'S SUCH A GREAT GUY. WHY DID HE CHEAT SO MUCH WITH HUNTER? WHERE IS HUNTER? WHERE IS HUNTER? WHERE IS HUNTER? REMEMBER WE DID THE TEACHER, WHERE IS HUNTER? NOW WE HAVE THE LAPTOP FROM HELL HELL. THE GREATEST LAPTOP I'VE EVER SEEN. THEY REFUSED TO LOOK AT IT. THE WORST. NOBODY HAS EVERYTHING EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. EXCEPT FOR ANTHONY. [LAUGHTER] MAYBE ANTHONY IS EVEN WORSE. ANTHONY, THAT WAS NOT GOOD. FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS, I'VE BEEN DELIVERING THE HISPANIC AMERICANS MESSAGE LIKE THEY HAVEN'T HEARD FOR A LONG TIME. [CHEERING] FIGHTING FOR SCHOOL CHOICE. [CHEERING] SCHOOL CHOICE, BIG DEAL. HISPANIC OWNED BUSINESSES. WE HAVE GREAT BUSINESS PEOPLE HERE. I KNOW SOME OF THEM. INCREDIBLE, ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE. LET ME RECOVER MY EARS FOR A SECOND. [LAUGHTER] [CHEERING] WHOEVER DID THIS MICROPHONE, DON'T PAY THEM. [LAUGHTER] HAVE A REPUTATION FOR NOT PAYING PAYING, IT IS A FALSE REPUTATION. WHEN SOMEONE DOES A LOUSY JOB LIKE A MICROPHONE THAT'S NO GOOD FOR TELEPROMPTERS THAT FLY WITH THE WIND. [LAUGHTER] I SAY DON'T PAY THEM. BUT WE LOVE OUR INCREDIBLE HISPANIC MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE HAVE A LOT OF THEM. [CHEERING] WE'VE ACHIEVED THE LOWEST HISPANIC AMERICANS, UNEMPLOYMENT EVER RECORDED. NOT EVEN CLOSE. WE ARE GETTING BACK TO THOSE NUMBERS AGAIN. THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS, 11.4 MILLION, A RECORD PEOPLE WERE HIRED. JOE BIDEN WOULD OBLITERATE EVERY SINGLE THING WE'VE DONE, HE IS LOOKING TO DO THAT. HE'S LOOKING TO OBLITERATE TAX CUTS. SO WE GAVE TAX CUTS THE BIGGEST IN HISTORY, HE WANTS TO END THE TAX CUT. WE WANT TO END THE CHILD TAX CREDIT. $1000 CHILD. WIPING OUT SMALL BUSINESSES WITH LOCKDOWNS, REGULATIONS, GETTING YOUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND DEVASTATING YOUR FAMILIES MASSIVE TAX HIKES. THE BIGGEST IN HISTORY. IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN. [CHEERING] HE WILL ATTACK RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND HIS RUNNING MATE, THE MOST LIBERAL MEMBER OF CONGRESS. SHE MAKES BERNIE SANDERS LOOK LIKE A SUPER CONSERVATIVE. WE WANT TO KNOW, WHO ARE THE JUDICIAL NOMINEES? WHO ARE THEY? WILL YOU PUT ON THE COURT? THEY WANT TO PACK THE COURTS. OUR NOMINEE. AMY. RIGHT? [CHEERING] FIGHTING WANTS TO BAN CHARTER SCHOOLS. EXTREME LATE-TERM ABORTION. LATE-TERM, EVEN BEYOND LATE-TERM. YOU SAW THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, THE CHILD IS BORN AND THEN THEY MAKE A DECISION AS THE EXECUTION OF THE CHILD. YOU SAW THAT. THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA. BIDEN TOTALLY SUPPORTS HIM AND SURRENDER YOUR COUNTRY TO THE VIOLENT SOCIALIST MOB, TAKE A LOOK AT PHILADELPHIA LAST NIGHT. WE OFFERED TO GO IN, OFFERED TO GO IN AND THEY SAID STAND BACK, STAND BACK THE POLICE WANT TO DO THEIR JOB. THEY DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. I THINK THEY ENDORSED ME, TOO. ALL POLICE DEPARTMENTS ENDORSED ME. THAT'S WHY WE ARE GOING TO WIN A RECORD SHARE OF HISPANIC AMERICANS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, ASIAN AMERICANS, WE ARE GOING TO WIN HISTORIC SHARE OF WOMEN. REMEMBER LAST TIME? [CHEERING] HE WILL NOT GET WOMEN. REMEMBER? [CHEERING] HE WILL NOT GET WOMEN. IT DIDN'T WORK OUT THAT WAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. WE DID VERY WELL WITH WOMEN. YOU KNOW WELL? THEY WANT SECURITY, THEY WANT SAFETY. IF THEY ARE FROM SUBURBIA, SUBURBAN WOMEN, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT? THEY WANT SECURITY AND THEY DON'T WANT THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS DESTROYED. I ENDED THE REGULATIONS THAT WOULD DESTROY THEM. [CHEERING] BUT I AM NOT JUST RUNNING AGAINST JOE BIDEN, I'M RUNNING AGAINST THE LEFT WING MOB AND LEFT WING MEDIA. THE BIG TECH GIANT AND I'M ALSO RUNNING AGAINST THE RHINOS. DO YOU KNOW WHAT A RHINO IS? A RHINO MAY BE THE LOWEST FORM OF HUMAN LIFE. I ACTUALLY THOUGHT OF THE OTHERS MORE THAN THE RHINOS. DO YOU KNOW WHY? [CHEERING] [CHEERING] THAT PLANE WAS ABOUT FOUR DAYS OLD. BRAND-NEW EQUIPMENT. [CHEERING] WE ARE THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. LOOK AT THAT. HE'S TRYING TO SHOW OFF FOR THE PRESIDENT THAT IS ONE OF OURS. GOT TO BE CAREFUL. THEY HAVE NOTHING BUT THE SAME FOR YOU, THEY LECTURE YOU ON OPEN BORDERS. WE ARE JUST NOW COMPLETING. VERY SOON MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT. [CHEERING] THEY LECTURE YOU ON EVERYTHING. I LOVE THAT SOUND. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I WENT THROUGH TO GET THOSE SUCKERS UP THERE. I HAD TO GET THE MONEY FROM THE DEMOCRATS. [CHEERING] LOOK AT THAT. LOOK, LOOK, LOOK! THEY GAVE THE PRESIDENT A LITTLE DISPLAY. [CHEERING] [CHEERING] [CHANTING] HOW ABOUT THAT? I WONDER IF THE FAKE NEWS CAUGHT THAT. DID YOU SEE THAT? THEY NEVER TURNED THE CAMERA. THEY DON'T WANT TO SHOW ANYTHING THAT'S GOOD. THAT WAS SOMETHING. WE ARE TRYING TO GET ATTENTION WITH THE INDEPENDENCE OVER HERE. THEY GOT MY ATTENTION EVEN THOUGH HE WAS VERY HIGH BUT THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. NOBODY IN THE WORLD HAS THE EQUIPMENT WE HAVE. I LOVE IT. [CHEERING] YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET DEMOCRATS TO PAY FOR THAT STUFF. THEY DON'T REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. THEY SUPPORT LOCKDOWNS WHILE JOBS REMAIN TOTALLY EXEMPT. THEY KEEP YOUR KIDS OUT OF SCHOOLS AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO TEACH IN SCHOOL? WE DON'T WANT TO TEACH THAT IN SCHOOL. WE ENDED THAT. FAMILIES HAVE PRIVATE TUTORS. THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS, SECOND AMENDMENT. SECOND AMENDMENT IS SO UNDER SIEGE. BUT WE ARE GOING TO KEEP YOUR SECOND AMENDMENT. NOTHING WILL BE CHANGED. I DON'T SEE THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA OR NEVADA, DON'T WORRY. I JUST LEFT NEVADA, BY THE WAY. I'LL BE BACK THERE VERY SOON. [CHEERING] THEY ALL HAVE ARMED GUARDS. WE HAVE TO TELL THESE PEOPLE, FROM NOW ON, NO MORE ARMED GUARDS. LET'S OUT LAW THE GUARDS. HOW ABOUT NANCY PELOSI? SHE GOES TO SAN FRANCISCO. [CROWD BOOING] SHE WANTS TO GET HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR REDONE IN SHE ENDS UP WITH A TOTAL TRUMP SUPPORTER AS THE OWNER OF THE BEAUTY PARLOR. [CHEERING] I LIKE THAT WOMAN. I'M GOING TO GO AND HAVE MY HAIR DONE BY THAT WOMAN. SHE WAS GREAT. WITH YOUR VOTE, IT IS WINDY. I THINK IT IS FROM THE F35 WE JUST SAW. [CHEERING] YOU CAN STAND THE WEALTHY LIBERAL HYPOCRITES, THEY WILL NEVER FORGET. UNDER BIDEN'S CRUEL AND SENSELESS LOCKDOWN, HAVE AMERICANS WILL DIE. FROM SUICIDE. DRUGS, MEDICAL CARE, SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. IT CANNOT BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. [CHEERING] ARIZONA, BUT NEVADA, GET YOUR GOVERNOR TO OPEN UP YOUR STATE, PLEASE. GET THEM TO OPEN YOUR STAY UP. THAT, GET THEM TO OPEN. GET THEM TO OPEN IT UP. IF YOU VOTE FOR BIDEN, YOUR KIDS WILL NOT BE IN SCHOOL. HE WANTS TO SHUT IT DOWN. HE SAID THE OTHER DAY, WE WILL SHUT IT DOWN. IT IS DEVASTATING FOR OUR NATION. WE DID JUST THE RIGHT THING, WE CLOSED IT DOWN. WE UNDERSTAND THE DISEASE, IT AFFECTS LIKE AS AN EXAMPLE, ME. GUESS WHO HAD IT? I HAD IT. I'M SURE NONE OF YOU HEARD THAT STORY. [LAUGHTER] IN FACT, THIS RALLY, USUALLY WE SET UP, WE DON'T GO TO RALLIES ANYWHERE, YOU ARE ALLOWED TO PROTEST BUT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GO TO CHURCH. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE DINNER WITH YOUR FRIENDS. YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING. WE CALL EVERYTHING A PROTEST SO WE HAVE NO PROBLEM. WE HAVE STATES WHERE YOU CAN ONLY PROTEST, YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE. ... ONE GENTLE LITTLE TOUCH TO THE FACE AND HE'S DOWN. THESE DOWN AND HE WOULDN'T GET UP VERY QUICKLY, WOULD HE?

BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND IT NOW, WE UNDERSTAND . PEOPLE ARE GETTING BETTER AND YOU KNOW YOUR IMMUNE, THAT'S WHY I CAN JUMP RIGHT THERE YOU NEED THOSE MEN, I'LL KISS THEM AND I'LL KISS EVERY MAN THERE AND KISS EVERY WOMAN THERE IF YOU DON'T MIND ALSO . THEY WON'T CATCH ANYTHING AND I WILL CATCH BECAUSE THEY SAY UNTIL I CAME ALONG, THEY SAID IF YOU HAVE IT, YOU GET BETTER. YOUR IMMUNE FOR LIFE. BUT WHAT I SAID, BETTER AND THEY SAID HE WILL.THE WHOLE MEDICAL CENTER. WAS THAT WAS GOOD FOR LIFE , BUT WITH ME THEY SAID I'M NOW GOOD FOR 4 MONTHS AND I THINK IT'S A MUCH LONGER PERIOD BUT WHO KNOWS, WE WILL KNOW SOON ENOUGH . WE'RE ON 1 MILLION DOSES OF A REALLY GREAT STATE THAT SCENE AND WE HAVE SOME OF THE GREATEST COMPANIES IN THE WORLD, THERE RIGHT AT THE DOORSTEP AND IF I WERE PRESIDENT, IF YOU HAD SLEEPY JOE AS YOUR PRESIDENT IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN YOU FOR YEARS TO HAVE A VACCINE, YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE HAD A VACCINE BUT WHAT WE DID WITH THE FDA THEY SAID WE WILL NEED APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS AND I SAID HOW ABOUT ONE WEEK ? WE'VE MOVED UP THE SCHEDULE AND GET WE WILL VANQUISH THE VIRUS AND EMERGE STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE. OUR COUNTRY WILL BE EVER STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE . NOW, WHAT I DID ONLY BECAUSE OF YOU AND THE DOUBLE STATE WITH A DOUBLE TREATMENT, WE NOW HAVE A NEW LITTLE THING, WE HAVE A BIG BOARD THAT SHOWS DIFFERENT THINGS AND HERE'S SOME OF THE GOVERNORS TALKING ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE JOB WE DID ON COVID OR THE CHINA VIRUS . EVERY TIME I CALL THE PRESENT HE'S GOTTEN ON THE LINE QUICKLY AND WE HAVE TO GET SUPPORT FOR THAT MERCY SHIP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND HE WAS ABLE TO DIRECT THAT IN REAL TIME CLASS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT DID WORKING WITH STATE WAS A PHENOMENAL ACCOMPLISHMENT . HAS BEEN ON IT AND I KNOW A TEAM WHEN THEY'RE ON IT AND I KNOW THE TEAM WHEN THEY'RE NOT ON IT . HIS TEAM IS ON IT YET THEY'VE BEEN RESPONSIVE , LATE AT NIGHT, EARLY IN THE MORNING . WERE WORKING WELL WITH FEMA AND THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS A FOR FIELD HOSPITALS. THAT WAS A DECISION OF PRESIDENT HIMSELF TOOK AND I'M THANKFUL TO BE FAIR, MAYBE BIDEN IS NOT TELLING US BECAUSE HE'S FORGOTTEN HIS OWN PLAN . WATCH BIDEN'S STAFF QUICKLY SWOOPED IN TO SHUFFLE HIM ALONG DURING A QUICKIE ESCAPE THE BASEMENT TRIP TO PENNSYLVANIA . WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY ARE WE GOING TO BE ? 4 MORE YEARS OF GEORGE, WERE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES IN THE POSITION WHERE IF TRUMP GETS ELECTED WHERE GOING TO BE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD . 56 PERCENT OF AMERICANS THAT THEY WERE BETTER OFF TODAY THAN THEY WERE FOUR YEARS AGO THAT THEY WERE UNDER THE OBAMA BIDEN AND MINISTRATION SO WHY SHOULD FEEL PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE THEY ARE BETTER OFF TODAY UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION VOTE FOR YOU ? IF THEY THINK THAT THEY PROBABLY SHOULDN'T . 54 PERCENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE BETTER OFF ECONOMICALLY TODAY AND THEY WERE IN OUR ADMINISTRATION , THEIR MEMORY IS NOT VERY GOOD QUITE FRANKLY . I'M RUNNING AS A PROUD DEMOCRAT FOR THE SENATE . SO VOTE. VOTE. I GOT IN TROUBLE AND WERE RUNNING AGAIN, THE SENATOR WAS A MORMON RED OR IT WAS THE CAN'T DO IT. CAN'T DO IT.YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A GREAT, GREAT COUNTRY BUT WE HAVE A COUNTRY WITH TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL . A COUNTRY THAT COULD BE GREATER AND EVER BEFORE . WE CAN'T DO THIS TO OURSELVES . WE CAN'T AREA AND I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK HE'S A NICE PERSON BUT THAT'S OKAY, I DON'T THINK HE'S A NICE GUY. IF HE WAS A NICE GUY I WOULDN'T HAVE PUT THOSE CLIPS UP BUT THOSE CLIPS ARE JUST A FEW OF MANY, MANY CLIPS . THAT JUST HAPPENED OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. WE CAN'T DO IT . FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WERE HERE TODAY HE SAY I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE OF OHIO FOR BEING WITH US. HE'S DONE THAT SEVEN DIFFERENT TIMES AND ONCE YOU DO THAT IT'S OVER . YOU JUST WALK OFF THE STAGE, YOU CAN NEVER MAKE A GOOD SPEECH AFTER THAT . NOBODY'S GOING TO GO HOME AND SAY THAT WAS A GREAT SPEECH EXCEPT FOR THE FACT HE CALLED US THE WRONG STATE . JOE BIDEN IS THE SPOKESMAN FOR THE RAGE FILLED EXTREMISTS AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO AND YOU CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN . THE DEMOCRATS HAVE SPENT THE ENTIRE YEAR INCITING VIOLENCE , HATRED AND HATRED AGAINST OUR POLICE . OUR POLICE. WITHOUT OUR POLICE WE HAVE VERY LITTLE. LAST NIGHT THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA WAS RANSACKED BY VIOLENT MOBS AND BIDEN SUPPORTED PEOPLE, THESE WERE ALL BIDEN SUPPORTED PEOPLE AND YOU WOULDN'T EVEN CALL THEM OUT . THIS MORNING THEY SAID PLEASE CALL THEM OUT, HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE THE RADICAL LEFT STORES WERE LOOTED, POLICE CARS WERE BURNED AND DOZENS OF OFFICERS, GREAT OFFICERS WERE INJURED . BIDEN AND HARRIS STAND UP AND A STAND WITH THE RIOTERS AND THE VANDALS AREA I STAND WITH THE HEROES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. [APPLAUSE] IT TOOK GENERATIONS TO BUILD THE AMERICA WE KNOW AND LOVE , BUT IF THE RADICAL LEFT GAINS POWER IT WILL TAKE THEM ONLY A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO DESTROY IT . THIS ELECTION DAY YOU MUST STOP THE ANTI-AMERICAN CRAZY RADICALS. THEY ARE CRAZY. THAT'S WHY I SAY THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY . I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY IT BECAUSE WE HAD A TIME LAST FOUR YEARS AGO , BUT BASED ON ABSOLUTELY INSANE . JOE BIDEN IS A CORRUPT POLITICIAN BUT BIG TECH WILL NOT ALLOW THAT TO BE SAID AND THE MEDIA WILL NOT SAY . WHAT HE HAS DONE IS HORRIBLE , THE MONEY FROM CHINA, FROM UKRAINE, FROM RUSSIA . THE MAYOR OF MOSCOW GAVE HIM THREE AND HALF MILLION TO THE SUN, THE SUN HAD NO JOB, NO NOTHING . GOT 3 AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS . THEY PUT HIM ON THE BOARD OF BURISMA, 100 E $3000 A MONTH AND I UNDERSTAND $3 MILLION UPFRONT PAYMENT, THEY COULD HAVE HAD HIM FOR LESS . CHINA GAVE HIM ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS TO MANAGE EVEN THOUGH HE'S NEVER MANAGED MONEY BEFORE YOU AND I ASK PEOPLE ON WALL STREET IS THAT COMMON?
