Kamala Harris embraced it.

Joe Biden is an empty vessel for it.It's Bernie Sanders's party – Joe Biden is just the empty vessel for it.As theFidel Castro-loving, Soviet Union-honeymooning,dictator-defendingcommunist comradekicks off the Democrat convention, it's a fitting reminder of just how far left the party has moved since the days of Barack Obama.

On nearly every issue, Biden has bowed down to the left-wing radicals running the Democrat Party.Sanders may not be on the ballot in November, butit's clear his agenda is.Sanders was the chief architect of Biden's "Unity Plan" — a dangerouscommunist manifestothatcopied directly from Sanders's platform.It calls for open borders,ending all deportations, deadly sanctuary cities, taxpayer-funded health care and welfare for illegal aliens, incentivizing illegal alien child smuggling, and much more.Sanders wants to raise taxes on the middle class, and so does Biden.Bidenwill raise taxesbymore than $4 trillion.

Taken together, Biden's proposals would costat least $10 trillion— a hint of just how much Biden will need to take from taxpayers to enact his extreme agenda.Sandersbraggedabout forcing Biden to move "a whole lot" to the left on health care.Biden's plan is the first step toward a socialist single-payer system, which wouldkill private health insurance plansand close rural hospitals across the country.

It would also givetaxpayer-funded health care to illegal aliens.Bidenembracedthe socialist Green New Deal, a job-killing war on energy written by Sanders and fellow socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.They'recallingfor a "fundamental transition" away from a free economy a radical plan to eliminate fossil fuels, ban fracking, and take a wrecking ball to the paychecks of hardworking Americans.Phony Kamala Harris— Joe Biden's political living will — was ratedthe most liberal member of the U.S.

Senate,even further left than Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.Sanders said he believesterrorists and rapists should have the right to votewhile they are in prison, and Harris said she was open to the idea.Harris said she wants toban the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans.Harris helped Sanders introduce his socialist takeover of health care, so-called "Medicare for All." She is still a cosponsor of the bill today.Harris and Sanders support AOC's socialist Green New Deal.They all supportbanning all fracking, a move that woulddecimate millions of energy jobsacross the United States.There is nothing moderate about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and Sanders's speech tonight proves it.
