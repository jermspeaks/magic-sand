Biden's new TV ad is just as dishonest as the last one.In Joe Biden's new TV ad, he falsely claims that President Trump is "proposing to eliminate a tax that pays for almost half of Social Security, without any way of making up for that lost revenue."Joe Biden is trafficking in fear. As The Washington Post Fact Checker determined, President Trump does not plan to eliminate the payroll tax, and he "reiterated that any diversion for a payroll tax holiday would come out of general funds.""[I] f transfers are made from general funds, no [Social Security] benefits would run out," adds the Fact Checker.Joe Biden's new Social Security ad is just as dishonest as the last one.It's a 4-Pinnochio lie!
