"Democrats structured their whole sham impeachment hearing strategy with Lt.

Col.

Alexander Vindman as the lynchpin and today it further fell apart.

Vindman confirmed that the transcript of the Ukraine phone call is accurate, was forced to admit that the President alone makes U.S.

foreign policy, and testified that Burisma was a corrupt company which employed the son of then-Vice President Joe Biden.

This could not have gone worse for Democrats, and could not have gone better for Americans sick to death of this concocted, bogus circus."- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
