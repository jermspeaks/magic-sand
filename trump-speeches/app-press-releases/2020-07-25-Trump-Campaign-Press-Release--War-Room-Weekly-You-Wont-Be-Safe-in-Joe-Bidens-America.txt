Joe Biden would redirect money from – or defund – local police departmentsand completely gut law enforcement because he is too weak to stand up to the extremist, anti-police leftists now in control of the Democrat Party.

That was the assessment of Sen.

Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) during an appearance tonight on 'War Room Weekly,' a show on President Trump's re-election campaign's Team Trump Online programming,hostedby Trump 2020 communications director Tim Murtaugh.

The bottom line is that Americans won't be safe in Joe Biden's America.Sen.

Blackburn expressed horror at the out-of-control leftist mobs wreaking havoc in Democrat-run cities and noted that Biden has refused to condemn them, instead labeling the rioters as "peaceful protesters." As the President of law and order, President Trump will always prioritize the safety of the American people and fulfill his promise to protect our nation.CLICK HERE TO WATCH"Joe Biden's abandonment of our law enforcement officers and promise to eviscerate police funding is not only radical – it's a dangerous threat to the everyday livelihood of innocent, hardworking Americans," saidSenator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN).

"We need four more years of President Trump to restore law and order in our streets and protect our communities from the radical demands of the far left.""As leftist mobs attack our nation's law enforcement officers and destroy our cities, Joe Biden continues to support the 'defund the police' movement and is too weak to stand up to the extreme left in his party," saidTim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 Communications Director."This radical movement has left the Democrat station, and Joe Biden is a hapless passenger on it."
