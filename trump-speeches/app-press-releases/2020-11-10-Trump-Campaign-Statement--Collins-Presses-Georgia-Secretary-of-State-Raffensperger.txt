Donald J.

Trump for President, Inc.

released the following statement from Rep.

Doug Collins (R-Ga.), who leads President Trump's campaign's recount team in Georgia:"As we begin the recount process, there are three things we are formally requesting today from Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.

First, there must be a full comparison of absentee ballots cast and in-person and provisional ballots cast throughout the state.

Second, there must be a check for felons and other ineligible persons who may have cast a ballot.

Third, and most importantly, the Secretary of State should announce a full hand-count of every ballot cast in each and every county due to widespread allegations of voter irregularities, issues with voting machines, and poll watcher access.

We can – and we will – petition for this in court after statewide certification is completed if the Secretary of State fails to act, but we are hopeful he will preemptively take this action today to ensure every Georgian has confidence in our electoral process."- Congressman Doug Collins (R-Georgia)
