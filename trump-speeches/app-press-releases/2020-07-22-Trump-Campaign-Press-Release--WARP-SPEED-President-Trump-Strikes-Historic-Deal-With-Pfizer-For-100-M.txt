Then, President Trump launched Operation Warp Speed to guarantee that the American people are first in line for a safe, effective coronavirus vaccine – at no cost – as soon as one is developed.The Trump Administrationjust announced a historic deal with Pfizerto secure 100 million doses of a vaccine – with nearly half a billion more to potentially follow – as soon as it is successfully approved and manufactured.According to the agreement, Pfizer will begin delivering the doses, which would be made available to the American people at no cost, to locations at the Trump Administration's direction.Out of five vaccines that the U.S.
