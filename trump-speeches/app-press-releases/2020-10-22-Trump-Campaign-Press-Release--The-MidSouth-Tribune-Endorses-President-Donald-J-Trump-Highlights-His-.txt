The Mid-South Tribune, an online news publication serving the Black community, has endorsed President Donald J.

Trump's re-election, citing four years of progress for Black voters across America.

From record low African-American unemployment rates, to criminal justice reform, to school choice, President Trump has delivered for the Black community.

While Joe Biden offers Black voters the same false promises and failed liberal policies he has peddled for forty-seven years in Washington, President Trump has developed thePlatinum Plan, a comprehensive roadmap for revitalizing Black communities.

In her publication's special editionendorsement, the editor-in-chief of The Mid-South Tribune described President Trump's many accomplishments and warned against the threat of Democrat leadership:"President Trump thinks outside the 'black' box.

He focuses on implementing economic policies which will benefit all Americans, because all Americans' lives matter.

African Americans should reject the Democrat Party's paved gold roads to Marxism, Socialism, and Communism â€“ under the guise of Democrat Socialism.

The Biden-Harris-Sanders-AOC-Congressional Black Caucus-Nancy Pelosi-Black Lives Matter-Antifa ticket will take the black community and America into economic genocide."Clickhereto read the full endorsement.
