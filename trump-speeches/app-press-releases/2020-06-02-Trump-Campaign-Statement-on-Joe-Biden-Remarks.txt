"Joe Biden's campaign made it clear that they stand with the rioters, the people burning businesses in minority communities and causing mayhem, by donating to post bail for those arrested.

He has obviously made the crass political calculation that unrest in America is a benefit to his candidacy.

Biden has a history of cozying up to notorious racists in the Senate, he attempted to inflame race relations by claiming Republicans want to put Black Americans 'back in chains,' and told a Black radio host that Blacks who didn't support him 'ain't Black.' He topped that off today by repeating the erroneous claim that protestors in Lafayette Park were tear gassed last night to clear a path for President Trump, when the Park Police says they used no tear gas and were not aware that the President was coming through.

Over the course of his public life, Joe Biden has used the politics of racial division when they suited his needs and he is doing it again.

In contrast, President Trump has addressed the nation twice, expressed horror and sorrow for the death of George Floyd, stood with the peaceful protestors, and made it clear that he would not abide our cities being overtaken by violent, uncontrollable rioters.

President Trump is restoring the nation to order and is clearly the leader we need to return the country to peace and prosperity."- Katrina Pierson, Trump 2020 senior advisor
