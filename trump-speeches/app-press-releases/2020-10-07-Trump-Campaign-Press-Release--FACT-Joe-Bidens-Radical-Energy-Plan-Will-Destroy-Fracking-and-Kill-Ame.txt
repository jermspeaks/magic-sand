Biden has repeatedly said he would dismantle the U.S. fracking industry and jeopardize millions of energy jobs.Over the last year,Biden repeatedly made it clear that fracking jobs would be eliminated, stopped, phased out, ended, and sacrificedin the name of his radical anti-energy agenda.Biden's war on fracking would decimate states likePennsylvania, where a fracking ban would decimate 609,000 jobs, andNew Mexico, where fracking workers are terrified of a "Biden ban."Bidenonce told an activistto "look at my eyes" and told her "I guarantee you we're going to end fossil fuel."Joe Biden has repeatedly expressed his support for wiping out fracking jobs and the fossil fuel industry:Biden admitted during a debate last year that there would be "no place" for fossil fuels, including fracking, in a Biden presidency, and that fossil fuels would be "eliminated."During a debate with Senator Bernie Sanders in March, Bidenexclaimed"so am I!" after Senator Sanders said he was campaigning on "stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can."Biden agreed with a supporter in January that fracking needed to be "stopped."Biden said in February that he wants to "phase out" fossil fuels such as fracking.Biden pledged to a supporter that he would "end" fossil fuels.Biden admitted he would "sacrifice" "hundreds of thousands" of fossil fuel jobs in pursuit of his anti-energy agenda.Biden even picked a vice presidential nominee who has flat out she is "in favor of banning fracking."Biden has proposed completelyeliminatingoil, gas, and coal from the U.S. power grid by 2035.He cannot honestly tell voters that the10.3 million American jobssupported by the fossil fuel industry will continue to exist under his anti-energy policies.
