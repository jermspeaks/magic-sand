"Having a debate moderator lie to try to explain away a tweet that revealed his anti-Trump slant is bad, but it is far from the biggest problem with the biased Commission on Presidential Debates. Filled with pro-Biden Democrats and anti-Trump 'Republicans,' the commission has done the bidding of Joe Biden every step of the way and protected him at every turn. There was no medical reason the candidates could not be on stage together tonight in Miami for the second debate, but instead they will be holding separate town halls. Everything the commission has done has been to benefit Joe Biden. Nevertheless, President Trump will be in Nashville on October 22, ready to debate Biden and beat him for a second time."- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
