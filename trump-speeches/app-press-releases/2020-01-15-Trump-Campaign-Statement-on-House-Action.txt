"The fact that Nancy Pelosi sat on the articles of impeachment for as long as she did just proves that there was never any urgency and that it was just a failed attempt to politically damage President Trump leading up to his re-election. This was a sham impeachment from the beginning and never anything more than Democrats trying to interfere in an election that is now less than ten months away."- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
