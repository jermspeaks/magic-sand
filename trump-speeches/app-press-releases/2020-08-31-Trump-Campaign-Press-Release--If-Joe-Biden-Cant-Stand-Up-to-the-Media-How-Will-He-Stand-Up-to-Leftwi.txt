Joe Biden today failed to stand up to the radicals in his party when he refused to call rioters what they are: violent left-wing mobs. The criminals ravaging American cities are aligned with the extreme elements of the Democrat Party, but Biden is too weak to say so and voters are noticing. As result, his handlers moved him out of his Delaware basement and sent him on a hasty trip to Pennsylvania to try to stop slipping poll numbers.Predictably, at his "press conference" today, Biden answered exactly zero questions. If he can't stand up to the media, how will he stand up to left-wing rioters or the radicals in his party?
