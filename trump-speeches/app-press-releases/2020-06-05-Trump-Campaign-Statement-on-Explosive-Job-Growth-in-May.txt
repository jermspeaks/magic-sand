"The great American comeback is underway after the economy was artificially interrupted by the global pandemic. Doomsday economists had predicted a loss of 8.5 million jobs in May, but the economy roared back and added 2.5 million jobs instead, thanks to President Trump's leadership and the solid foundation his policies have laid. Sadly, Democrat leaders in blue states have kept the economy from reopening for all Americans, preventing everyone from sharing in the economic rebirth as the people most heavily impacted by COVID are not yet seeing improvement. Incredibly, Joe Biden is counting on more economic pain for Americans so he can capitalize on it politically. It is disgusting and sad that Biden and the Democrats are openly worrying that America will get back to work because it would be bad news for them."- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
