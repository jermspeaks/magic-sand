Even Biden's top public health advisor admitted it was "purely a fortuity" that H1N1 wasn't "one of the great mass casualty events in American history."Joe Biden likes to claim he left President Trump a "playbook" for managing the coronavirus pandemic.That's a fantasy, unsupported by even the most basic facts.The reality is, the Obama-Biden Administration's swine flu response was a disaster, and Obama admitted that Biden"helped me manage H1N1."FACT: The Obama-Biden Administration left the Strategic National Stockpile indangerously short supplyof N-95 respirator masks after deploying nearly all of them to combat the 2009 swine flu pandemic.There's no evidence that any effort was made to replenish the stockpile despite experts calling on the Obama-Biden Administration to do so. This is a serious failure for whichBiden has still refusedto accept responsibility.FACT: The Obama-Biden Administrationstopped all swine flu testingin the middle of the 2009 pandemic.Under Vice President Biden, the CDC was overruled and public health officials who insisted testing was still necessary were ignored.As CBSreported at the time:"Some public health officials privately disagreed with the decision to stop testing and counting, telling CBS News that continued tracking of this new and possibly changing virus was important[.] "FACT: The Obama-Biden Administration completely botched the development and deployment of a swine flu vaccine, making several mistakes thatdelayed productionand caused supply shortages.Indeed, as Biden's former chief of staffadmitted in 2019, the Obama-Biden Administration did "every possible thing wrong" during the 2009 swine flu."It is purely a fortuity," Ron Klain admitted, "that this isn't one of the great mass casualty events in American history."If H1N1 had the same case fatality rate as the coronavirus, of roughly 2.8 percent, there would have been more than 1.7 million deaths from the60 million U.S. cases.Biden hasn't answered for any of this, nor has the media asked him about it.The coronavirus timeline simply doesn't supportBiden'sfairy talesabout how he was sounding the alarm before anyone else. And the record certainly doesn't support his claim that he left a winning "playbook," either.
