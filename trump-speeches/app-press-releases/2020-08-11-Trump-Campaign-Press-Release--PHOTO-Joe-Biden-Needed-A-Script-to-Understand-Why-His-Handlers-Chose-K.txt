Biden is an empty vessel for the radical left.Joe Biden's radical-left handlers are telling him what to do, andthey just accidentally tweeted out the evidence.A photo released by the Biden campaign showsBiden reading from a typed script on a paper in front him, holding his phone upside down, as he asked Harris to be his political living will."I've had a lot of great advice. I am calling you today,"Biden's script reads in part. "I think you are entitled to know why I chose you. There are three reasons," it continues.Biden is nothing but a weak "transition" candidate and an empty vessel for the radical left.The script typed up for him proves it.
