None of them supported President Trump in 2016.The four "Republicans" featured at the Democrat convention tonight arenothing but useful idiots for the radical left.

They would have gladly turned over our country to Crooked Hillary, and they're still supporting the far-left Democrat agenda.Here's the truth:John Kasichis a sore loser and a political opportunist whowent back on his wordto support the Republican nominee in 2016.

In 2012, he saidJoe Biden was a liar.

Apparently they both are!Susan Molinariis a swamp creature who made millionslobbying on behalf of Vladimir Putin.

When she worked for Russia,she lobbied then-Senator Joe Biden's officeon multiple occasions.Meg Whitmanvoted for Crooked Hillary Clinton in 2016 and was even her guest at the final presidential debate.Christine Todd Whitmanvoted for Crooked Hillary Clinton in 2016.A sore loser, a Putin pal, and two Crooked supporters.

Who would want those endorsements?
