"This is further proof that even though Bernie Sanders won't be on the ballot in November, his issues will be.

Biden had to adopt most of Bernie's agenda to be successful in the Democrat primaries.

One thing that is missing is enthusiasm, however, as almost no one is excited about a Biden candidacy.

And while Biden is the Democrat establishment's candidate, President Trump remains the disruptor candidate who has brought change to Washington.

President Trump's supporters will run through a brick wall to vote for him.

Nobody is running through a brick wall for Joe Biden."- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
