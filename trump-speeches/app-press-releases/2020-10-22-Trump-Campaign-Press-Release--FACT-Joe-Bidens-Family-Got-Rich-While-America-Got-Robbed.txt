The revelations from Hunter Biden's laptop are only the tip of the iceberg.Thelatest Senate reporton Hunter Biden's lucrative foreign business dealings only adds more shocking revelations to the Biden family's web of contacts with Russian oligarchs and Chinese Communist officials."We've got people all around the world who want to invest in Joe Biden," his brother reportedly told corporate executives in 2006.

The Biden family wasn't shy aboutusing their status to enrich themselves,often at the expense ofthe forgotten, working-class Americans Biden left behind:Hunter Biden's firmreceiveda $3.5 million wire transfer in 2014 from Russian billionaire Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.Hunter Bidenhadzero experiencein the energy sector, but he was paid boatloads of cash bya corrupt Ukrainian gas companyfor a no-show job while his father was directing the Obama Administration's Ukraine policy as vice president.

Hunter landed the sweetheart gigwithin weeks of his father's visitto Ukraine.Hunter opened a joint bank account with a Chinese national tied to the Communist government.

The accountfinanced a $100,000 global spending spreefor Hunter as well as Joe Biden's brother James and his wife Sara.While Joe Bidenadvocated for legislation favored by big banksthat made it harder for struggling Americans to declare bankruptcy, Biden's son Hunter was"earning" hundreds of thousands of dollars in "consultant fees"from one of those banks, MBNA.While Biden oversaw Iraq policy, a construction firm that employed Biden's brother Jamesmagically secured $1.5 billion in contracts in Iraq.Biden's brother Frank has called his last name"a tremendous asset"for his personal business ventures."Biden's brother [James] told executives at a healthcare firm that the former vice president's cancer initiative would promote their business, according to a participant in the conversation, who said the promise came as part of a pitch on behalf of potential investors in the firm," according toPolitico.Biden's brother James bought land on a Caribbean island in 2005, then turned around andsold one-third of it the next yearto a lobbyist close to Biden for what had been the cost of the entire property.While Biden was vice president, his son Hunterjoined him on Air Force Twofor a trip to China.

While in Beijing he arranged for his Chinese business partner to meet his father.Ten days after the trip, Hunter's firm received an approval from the Chinese government-owned Bank of China that paved the way for more than a billion dollars in business for Hunter's firm.About one-fifth of the $11 million Biden's 2008 presidential campaign raisedwent to Biden family membersthrough companies that employed them.As early as the 1970s, Biden's brother James wascashing in on his nameto secure "unusually generous" loans while then-Senator Biden sat on the Senate Banking Committee.While Biden was vice president, the Delaware non-profit where his daughter was executive directorreceived a federal granttotalling $166,000.Biden's son-in-law Howard Krein founded an investment consultancy that immediately received special access to the Obama White House with Biden's help.While Biden's family was getting rich, America was getting robbed.Beijing Biden spent decades in Washington advancing China's interests and supporting terrible trade deals like NAFTA and TPP.No wonder China wants to see Biden win in November.Bidendismissed workers' concernsand voted for NAFTA in 1993, costing 850,000 Americans their jobs and shattering middle-class communities.Campaigning for president in 2007, Bidenpromised to renegotiate NAFTA.

But when he had the chance as vice president, hefailed to even lift a finger.Biden led the effort togive China "most favored nation" trade status, saying he did not foresee "the collapse of the American manufacturing economy" because of the deal.

1 million American manufacturing jobs were lost between 2000 and 2007because of Biden's poor judgement.Biden hasrepeatedly dismissed the threat that China posesto American workers.

He even went out of his way topromote China's interests in outer space.As vice president, Biden led the fight in support ofthe job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)trade deal, which would have killed nearly half a million American jobs, shrunk our economy, and beena catastrophe for the peopleof Scranton and Allentown and Pittsburgh.Biden is still trying to kill American jobs.He recentlypledged to "sacrifice" hundreds of thousands of blue-collar paychecksin pursuit of his radical Green New Deal agenda.

He said he willban fracking and take millions of cars off the road.Millions of Americans wereignored and left behindby Joe Biden, who put his family and foreign countries like China first and America last.

Our country can't afford to let him do that again.
