The Trump economy was delivering huge wage gains for workers before the Chinese coronavirus reached our shores.President Trumpbuilt the greatest economy in history once and he's doing it again. The only thing that could stop the Great American Comeback is Joe Biden's disastrous economic agenda.Before the artificial interruption to our economy, wages for typical workerswere risingat their fastest rate in a decade:According to theWall Street Journal, wages for "rank-and-file" workers were growing at the fastest rate in a decade, outpacing those of their bosses.Wages for the bottom quarter of workerswere outpacinggains for high income workers.Wages for Black Americanswere growing even faster.
