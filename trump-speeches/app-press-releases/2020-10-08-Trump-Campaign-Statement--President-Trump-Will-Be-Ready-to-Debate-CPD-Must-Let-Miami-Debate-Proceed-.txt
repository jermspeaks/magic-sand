President Trump's re-election campaign today released the following statement:"President Trump's physician, Dr.

Sean Conley, says the President will be medically cleared for 'safe return to public engagements' by Saturday, five full days before the originally scheduled debate in Miami on October 15.

There is therefore no medical reason why the Commission on Presidential Debates should shift the debate to a virtual setting, postpone it, or otherwise alter it in any way.

CPD Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf admits that they consulted with no one before unilaterally changing the format of a debate, well in advance of any knowledge of what the President's condition would be on debate night.

The commission must stop protecting Joe Biden from this in-person debate and allow the event to proceed as it was agreed to months ago.

The American people can see through this obvious attempt to shield Biden from another shellacking like he got two weeks ago in Cleveland and the CPD must reverse course and let the debate proceed."- Bill Stepien, Trump 2020 campaign manager
