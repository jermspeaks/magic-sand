Trump for President, Inc.

announced the launch of a new Spanish-language TV ad, "Sammy's," highlighting President Trump's fight to ensure Hispanic Americans have the opportunity to achieve the American dream.

The ad features the owners of Sammy's Mexican Grill, a Hispanic-owned family business in Phoenix, Arizona that has flourished under President Trump's economic leadership.

The ad comes as the Trump campaign announcesradio advertising addressing the concerns Mexican Americansand other Hispanics have with the growing extremism of the left.The President met with the small business owners featured in "Sammy's" during a recent trip to Arizona.

Just like Goya Foods, their business was viciously slandered by intolerant leftists because of their support for President Trump.

However, they stood strong in their convictions and continue to support the President and his pro-business, pro-family policies.

Hispanics across America are leaving the Democrat Party in droves as Joe Biden pushes to take educational and economic opportunity away from their communities and undermine the family values at the heart of Hispanic culture.

This ad will run in Arizona, where the owners of Sammy's Mexican Grill reside.
