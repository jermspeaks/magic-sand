"The only thing Joe Biden knows about handling a public health crisis is that the Obama White House had to apologize for his remarks that set off a panic during the swine flu outbreak in 2009. And when President Trump took the critical step of restricting travel from China in response to the coronavirus, Biden called it 'xenophobic.' Most of what Biden says the government should do are things President Trump is already doing. The President is leading an unprecedented mobilization of America against the coronavirus and all Joe Biden can offer is ineffective partisan sniping from the sidelines."- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
