"Tonight, 2020 Democrats were short on solutions and heavy on their unhealthy obsession with taking down President Trump via an illegitimate coup. They know they cannot beat President Trump's record-breaking economy, landmark criminal justice reform, falling healthcare costs, and historic trade deals, so they are set to defeat him in the halls of Congress rather than at the ballot box. The vote of the American people matters little to the 2020 Democrats. Their goal is singular and unified: defeat Trump at any cost."- Kayleigh McEnany, Trump 2020 national press secretary
