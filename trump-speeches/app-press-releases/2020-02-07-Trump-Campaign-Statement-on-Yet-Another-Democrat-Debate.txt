"Democrats were given multiple opportunities tonight to denounce socialism and none of them did. They also made clear that if they'd been in charge, they'd never have given the order to take out Qassem Soleimani, the notorious terrorist responsible for killing hundreds of Americans. As a major political party they are hopelessly out of touch with the majority of Americans. By contrast, President Trump has reinvigorated the American Dream, brought unemployment to generational lows, increased paychecks for low- and middle-income Americans, and lowered healthcare and prescription drug costs for people nationwide. President Trump will crush whichever Democrat is unlucky enough to face him in November."- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
