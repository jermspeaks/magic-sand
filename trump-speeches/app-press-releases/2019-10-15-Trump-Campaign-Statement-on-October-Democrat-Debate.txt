"A dozen Democrats stood on stage tonight and made several things clear. They have always wanted to impeach President Trump, they have always wanted to eliminate employer-provided health insurance, they have always wanted to raise your taxes, and they have always wanted to unravel the hottest economy in modern history. Another thing was also clear: Once again, President Trump was the hands-down winner of this debate."- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
