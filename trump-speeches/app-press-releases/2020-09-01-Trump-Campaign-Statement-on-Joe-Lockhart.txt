President Trump's re-election campaign today issued the following statement regarding former Clinton White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart's ludicrous and reckless speculation that President Trump had a stroke:"CNN should fire Joe Lockhart, a lifetime failure who thought it was a great idea for fellow loser Michael Dukakis to put on that stupid helmet, for knowingly pushing a conspiracy theory about President Trump's health. Great political expert that he is, Lockhart single-handedly sank the John Kerry campaign and now he's doing the same to Joe Biden from a distance. If another CNN employee said similar things about Barack Obama they'd be fired immediately, so the same standard should be applied here. That is, of course, unless CNN is complicit in the smear campaign in order to level the playing field against Joe Biden, somebody who truly has lost a step."
