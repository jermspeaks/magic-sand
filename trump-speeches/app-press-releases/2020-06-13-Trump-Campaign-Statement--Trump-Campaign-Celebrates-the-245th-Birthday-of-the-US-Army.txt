On the 245th Birthday of the United States Army, Veterans for Trump Co-Chair Graham Allen issued the following statement."Today we celebrate the 245th Birthday of the United States Army.

Established in 1775 before our Republic itself, the U.S.

Army represents the very best of everything we hold dear as Americans, such as liberty, freedom, and honor.

Especially at times of uncertainty, Americans can always rely on the men and women warriors of the U.S.

Army.

We join President Trump and all of America today with a salute, a wave, or a tip of the hat to every soldier, reservist, and veteran to celebrate one of our nation's most vaunted institutions and the fiercest fighters anywhere in the world.

GO Army!"
