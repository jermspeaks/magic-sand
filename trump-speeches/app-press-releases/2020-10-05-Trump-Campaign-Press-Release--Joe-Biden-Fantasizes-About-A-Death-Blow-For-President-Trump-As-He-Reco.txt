Despicable.Joe Biden, the self-proclaimed candidate of civility, stooped to a new low today. While President Trump is at Walter Reed Medical Center, Biden asked voters to fantasize aboutPresident Trump receiving a "coup de grâce," or death blow."Think about this, wouldn't it be an irony, the irony of all ironies, if on election-eve it turned out the Haitians delivered the coup de grâce in this election," said Biden in Miami. Meriam-Webster defines a coup de grâce as "a death blow or death shotadministered to end the suffering of one mortally wounded."(WATCH)Biden's remark comes after he attacked President Trump withlies about Social Securityandcontinued to run attack adson TVdespite claiming he was taking them down.
