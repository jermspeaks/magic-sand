"In the past, Joe Biden has shown terrible judgment and incompetence in the face of public health issues.

The Obama White House had to publicly apologize for and clean up after Biden when his irresponsible remarks caused panic during the swine flu outbreak in 2009.

Just weeks ago, he was openly critical of President Trump's early move to restrict travel from China to the United States in response to the coronavirus â€“ a decision which medical experts agree helped impede the spread of the virus to this country.

Yesterday his campaign actually raised the vile conspiracy theory that the President purposely allowed the coronavirus to spread.

In times like this, America needs leadership and Biden has shown none.

President Trump acted early and decisively and has put the United States on stronger footing than other nations.

His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens' fears."- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
