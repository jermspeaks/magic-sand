Biden will raise taxes on middle class Americans.To help Americans weather the global pandemic, the Trump Administration delayed the tax filing deadline from April 15 to today, July 15.Joe Biden won't be easing anyone's burden if he's elected.

In fact,if Biden gets his way, Americans will have less money in their pockets next year.

He's said thefirst thing he would do as presidentis "eliminate the president's tax cut."Raising taxes onmiddle-class Americanswould strangle our economy, but Biden's planning a long list of tax hikes that will hurt workers and families:Americans will facesignificant tax increasesto fund Joe Biden's $2 trillion radical plan to kill affordable American energy.Americans will have higher household costsfor heating and cooling if Biden implementshis carbon tax.Americans willpay higher utility billsevery single month if Biden repeals the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.American jobs will be shipped overseasbecause of Biden'splan to hike the U.S.

corporate tax ratehigher than the rate in communist China.Biden's promise to reinstate Obamacare's individual mandate tax willdisproportionately hurt low income Americans.President Trump's tax cutshelped spur America's record-breaking economic growthprior to the artificial economic interruption from the coronavirus.

Biden's plan to repeal President Trump's tax cuts and raise taxes on middle class Americanswould be a gut punch to workers and smother job creationexactly when we need it most.President Trump doubled theChild Tax Credit, instituted a 20% tax deduction forsmall businesses, and createdOpportunity Zones to spur investment in struggling communities.Joe Biden doesn't care.

He wants to eliminate it.Biden oversawthe worst economic recovery since the Great Depression.

Looking at his disastrous plan to raise taxes on families, it's not hard to see why.He will raise taxes by$4 trillion over the next 10 years,more than double the tax increase proposed by Hillary Clinton.President Trump built the strongest economy in history once, andhe will do it again.The onlything that can stop the Great American Comebackis Biden's failed, old, liberal ideas.
