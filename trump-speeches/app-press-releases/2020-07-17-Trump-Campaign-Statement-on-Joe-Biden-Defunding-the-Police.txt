"President Trump is 100 percent correct in his assessment that Joe Biden would defund the police.

The media is bending over backwards to let Joe Biden get away with playing with synonyms to give him a pass.

He has clearly stated that he would 'Yes!

Absolutely!' redirect funding away from police to other budget areas.

This is cutting, or defunding, the police by any definition.

Further, the proposed destruction of qualified immunity for police in the Biden-Sanders platform would financially eviscerate local police departments in communities across the United States, effectively bankrupting and destroying them.

Joe Biden is an empty vessel, which the extreme left is using to carry their radical agenda.

President Trump stands with law enforcement and ensuring safe policing and safe communities."- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
