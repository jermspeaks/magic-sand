"Bernie Sanders is the wrong prescription for fighting an outbreak like the coronavirus. Like Joe Biden, Sanders advocates a government takeover of healthcare, which would close hundreds of rural hospitals. His plan would drive doctors and other medical workers away from the profession, leaving America woefully unprepared for public health emergencies. Further, he's said he would not even consider closing our borders to protect our people, even if it were necessary to control the spread of the virus. He's just another Democrat candidate for president trying to score political points by recklessly provoking anxiety and fear."- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
