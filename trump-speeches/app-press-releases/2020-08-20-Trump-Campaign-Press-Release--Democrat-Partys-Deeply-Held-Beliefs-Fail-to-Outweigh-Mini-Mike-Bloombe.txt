Democrats ignore Bloomberg's racism and sexism for money.A few short months ago, Democrats on the debate stage savaged Mini Mike Bloomberg as aracistand asexist.Now, in another massive blow to their #MeToo credibility, they're giving him a prime speaking slot at their convention–right after they honoredBill Clinton.Elizabeth Warren, who spoke last nightafter a segment emphasizing the importance of supporting survivors, led the charge against Bloomberg earlier this year.

"Why shouldn't I believe" the woman who made allegations against Bloomberg, Warrenasked.

"I believe the woman… why would she lie?"Joe BidencriticizedBloomberg for not doing enough to address the allegations against him.But then Bloomberggavea whopping $18 million to the Democrat Party and all was forgotten.Democrats are also hoping viewers forget Bloomberg's scathing attacks on Biden's capacity to be president.Bloombergwarnedthat President Trump would "eat alive" Bidenbecause Biden doesn't have "practical" plans and lacks "management experience."?
