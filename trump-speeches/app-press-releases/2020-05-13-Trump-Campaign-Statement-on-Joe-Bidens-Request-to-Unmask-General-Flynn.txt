"Joe Biden's limp claim that he doesn't know anything about the railroading of Gen.

Michael Flynn just got even more unbelievable.

Biden is listed among the Obama administration officials who requested the unmasking of Flynn.

We already knew Biden was briefed on the Flynn case before President Trump took office and now we know that he wanted Flynn unmasked.

Americans have a right to know the depth of Biden's involvement in the setup of Gen.

Flynn to further the Russia collusion hoax."- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
