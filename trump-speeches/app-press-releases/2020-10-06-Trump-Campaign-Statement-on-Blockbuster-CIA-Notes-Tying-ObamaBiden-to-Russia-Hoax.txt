"We now know that Hillary Clinton hatched a plan to divert attention away from her use of a private email server by falsely tying then-candidate Donald Trump to Russia.

We also know that former CIA Director John Brennan briefed President Obama on that plot.

It is imperative that the American people now learn what then-Vice President Joe Biden knew about this conspiracy and when he knew it.

What did Biden know about Clinton's plan to use the Russia Hoax to try to smear her political opponent?

Did Biden condone the plan?

Did he express any misgivings about it or remain silent?

Biden must give a full accounting of his knowledge and his conversations about Clinton's scheme, which was known to the highest reaches of his administration."- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
