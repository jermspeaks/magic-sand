CLICK HERE TO WATCH "CUENTO CHINO"President Trump's re-election campaign launched a new Spanish-language ad today titled "Cuento Chino" (Chinese Tale), highlighting how Hispanic workers and families would suffer the brunt of Joe Biden's weakness toward Communist China. The new ad is running in key states and comes as polls show Joe Biden continues to alienate Hispanic voters while President Trump expands his diverse coalition. Bidenâ€™s pro-China agenda has hurt Hispanic families, including our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico who saw their jobs and major industries sent to China under his failed policies. Unlike Joe Biden, President Trump is holding Communist China accountable for their unfair trade practices and securing historic trade deals that put America first.
