July saw the third largest jobs gain in U.S.

history and was three times bigger than Biden's best month.The U.S.

economyadded 1.8 million jobsin July.

The unemployment rate fellnearly a full point.After May and June's record-busting jobs reports, today's news is yet another signPresident Trump is making America's economy great again.

Despite the liberal media's attemptto downplay it, it's undeniable that today's jobs report is another smashing success.Notably, 1.1 million of the jobs added last month went to women.

The unemployment rate fell across the board, including for women, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and veterans.This jobs report is also a reminder that Joe Biden's polices would strangle the Great American Comeback.

Bidenpresided over the slowest economic "recovery" since the Great Depression; for comparison,today's report of 1.8 million jobs added ismore than three times biggerthan the best month Joe Biden ever delivered.Despite his record of failure, Biden is pledging to repeat his mistakes,doubling down on his failed, old, liberal ideasof raising taxes, more red tape,smothering American-made energyand sacrificing jobs.President Trump is the only candidate who knows how to fire up our country's economic engine with pro-worker policies that put America first.
