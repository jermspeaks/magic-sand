In honor of Memorial Day, Lt.

Col.

Tony Shaffer (Ret'd.), a member of the Donald J.

Trump for President, Inc.

Advisory Board, released the following statement."Memorial Day is a day of sacred observance that was set aside to honor our war dead, a tradition that began during the Civil War.

The history of the sacrifice Memorial Day honors, however, dates back further â€” to the opening shots of the American Revolution.

Since that time, more than one million Americans have sacrificed their lives to safeguard our God-given liberties.

These were patriotic heroes who will never be forgotten.

Today, as our nation begins to rise again from this global pandemic, we join President Trump and the rest of the nation in honoring those who made the supreme sacrifice for our freedoms."
