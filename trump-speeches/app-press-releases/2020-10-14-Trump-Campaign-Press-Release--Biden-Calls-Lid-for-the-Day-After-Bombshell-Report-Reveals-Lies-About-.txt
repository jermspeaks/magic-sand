One email from Pozharskyi to Hunter Biden says, "thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together. It's realty [sic] an honor and pleasure,"An earlier email from Pozharskyi to Hunter Biden asks for "advice on how you could use your influence."Biden has previously claimed to have no knowledge of his son's business schemes, saying, "I have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings."Less than a year after Joe Biden met with Pozharskyi and Hunter Biden, then-Vice President Bidenpressured Ukrainian officials into firing the prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.
