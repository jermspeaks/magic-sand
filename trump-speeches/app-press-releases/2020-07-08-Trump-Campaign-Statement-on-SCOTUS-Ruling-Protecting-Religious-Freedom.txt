"Joe Biden's decade-long war against Catholic nuns and the Little Sisters of the Poor is finally over. Today's Supreme Court ruling is a landmark win for religious liberty. Unlike Joe Biden, President Trump has been a staunch defender of religious freedom since taking office and will always fight to defend communities of faith."- Ali Pardo, Trump 2020 Deputy Communications Director
