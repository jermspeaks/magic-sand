Joe Biden's laundry list of failures include job killing trade deals, tax hikes, skyrocketing drug prices, and amnesty for illegal immigrants who will compete with hardworking Americans for jobs.

On November 3rd, the American people will tell this career bureaucrat and professional failure that they've had enough.

President Trump's re-election campaign today released a new ad detailing the devastating results of Biden's 47 years of absolute failure.

Joe Biden has spent 47 years in Washington D.C.

and hasn't solved a single problem, choosing instead to enrich his family and the establishment.

With just one week left until Election Day the choice is clear: the only way to ensure our country stays safe from the catastrophic effects of Biden's failed policies is to re-elect President Trump for four more years.Click here to watch "Joe Biden Will Fail Again"
