Supreme Court, radical Democrats are vowing to "pack the court" with far-left judicial activists if Democrats are given power.So far, Joe Biden hasrefusedto reject the idea."It's a legitimate question, but let me tell you why I'm not going to answer that question," Bidensaidin an interview with WBAY-TV in Wisconsin."What I'm not going to do, and I hope you'll understand, is play the president's game.

He wants to change the subject," BidentoldWRAL-TV in North Carolina.

"I'm not gonna get into that.""I know you're going to be upset with my answer, but ...

if I were to say yes or no to that, that becomes a big issue.

That's the headline here," Bidensaidlast weekend.Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, has also recentlyrefused to answer questionsabout court packing despite beingwillingin the past to ignore historical precedent and add more Justices to the Supreme Court.Biden's refusal to directly answer the question appears to reverse his long standing opposition to such a move.For decades, Bidendenounced court-packingas a"bonehead idea,"a"power grab,"and"damaging."So what changed?

Biden is now controlled by the radical left who will try to pack the Supreme Court as soon as they get the chance.

Biden can't answer the question because he knows the answer is yes.
