"We don't need to guess what a Biden economy would look like since Americans have been forced to live through it once already.

Biden's policies caused the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression, anemic job growth, and depressed wages for the workers left.

Biden's NAFTA destroyed 850,000 American jobs and his inexplicable support for China killed millions more and forced 60,000 American factories to close.

Now, Biden proudly brags he has borrowed his economic plans from Bernie Sanders, saying he'll raise taxes on all Americans – including the middle class – and impose crippling Green New Deal regulations on job-creators that already forced so many American companies to leave our shores for other countries.

President Trump built the greatest economy anyone alive has ever known before the unprecedented global pandemic, and he's already doing it again.

President Trump's policies created more jobs and prosperity for every American in three years than Joe Biden could muster in nearly half a century.

Biden's willful attack on our jobs, our families, and the American way of life will reverse all the gains we've made together and plunge us into economic catastrophe."- Hogan Gidley, Trump 2020 national press secretary
