Packed with radical policies and politicians, the first night of the Democrat convention failed to discuss the issues Americans care about.Last night, Americans who tuned into the Democrat convention heard lots of talk about far-left policies from out-of-touch speakers. If you managed tostay awake, you were treated to:A speech from a registered Russian lobbyistA painful, tired joke about Home Alone 2The governor who's overseen the worst coronavirus response in the countrycalling the pandemic a "metaphor"What you didn't hear was anything about the important issues the American people are concerned about. Below is a list of just some of the things Democrats failed to mention on the first night of their convention:Joe Biden's plan to raise $4 trillion in taxesBringing back American jobsRaising wagesThe threat posed by ChinaSchool choiceSecuring the borderBiden's plan to halt all deportationsBiden's plan to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrantsAmerican energy independenceThe cost of Biden's radical energy plansA condemnation of the "Defund The Police" movementA defense of Second Amendment rightsGiving veterans the care they deserveReducing health care costsFighting the scourge of opioid addiction
