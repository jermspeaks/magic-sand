"Kayleigh McEnany is a first class professional who will serve President Trump and the American people well. She has been one of the strongest assets to the President's re-election campaign with her keen mind, positive attitude, strong faith, and tireless work ethic. We don't think of it as losing a team member, rather as having a trusted colleague called upon to fill a very important role. President Trump has made an excellent choice."- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
