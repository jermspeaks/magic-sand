"We are deeply saddened to learn of Herman Cain's passing.

Herman was an icon and a personification of the American Dream.

In business, in politics, and in service to God, Herman was a leader and an incredible human being.

We were honored to consider him part of our Trump campaign family and a key advisor to the Black Voices for Trump coalition.

We mourn as one nation today for him, and our deepest prayers and condolences are with his wife Gloria and his children Melanie and Vincent.

Herman's legacy will last for generations.

May he Rest in Peace."- Katrina Pierson, Trump 2020 senior advisor
