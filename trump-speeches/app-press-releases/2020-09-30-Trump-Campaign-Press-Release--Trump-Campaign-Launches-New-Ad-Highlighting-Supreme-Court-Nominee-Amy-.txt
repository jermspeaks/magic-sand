President Trump's re-election campaign today unveiled a new television ad highlighting the President's Supreme Court Pick, Amy Coney Barrett, as a Constitutional conservative, proud Christian, and mother of seven. As President Trump fights to protect Americans' conservative values, the radical Democrat Party is launching desperate attacks on Judge Barrett's faith and family. This newly released ad, airing on network cable, is a part of an 8 figure ad buy, and urges Americans to support President Trump and stand up for conservative values.Click to watch "ACB"
