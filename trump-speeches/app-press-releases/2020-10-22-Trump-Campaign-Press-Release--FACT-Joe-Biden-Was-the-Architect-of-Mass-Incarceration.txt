President Trump commuted her sentence in 2018.Bidenworked with segregationist Senator Strom Thurmondto pass laws incarcerating Americans caught with a quarter-sized amount of crack cocaine.Biden voted to extend minimum penalties for people under 21 charged with selling marijuana, and introduced the civil forfeiture legislation which allows the government to seize assets of citizens accused of drug crimes.Biden helped write the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which created the 100:1 crack cocaine sentencing disparity and disproportionately targeted minority communities.Biden's own running mate Kamala Harris blamed him for writing laws that led to the mass incarceration of Black Americans.
