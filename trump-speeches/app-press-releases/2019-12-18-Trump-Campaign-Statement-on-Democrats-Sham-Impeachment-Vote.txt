"The contrast between President Trump and the Democrats couldn't be more clear.

While the President rallied with tens of thousands of citizens in Michigan and celebrated the greatness and success of America, Democrats in D.C.

completed their cold, calculated, and concocted 3-year impeachment sham and voted against 63 million Americans.

And the only part of the vote that was bipartisan was in opposition.

The President is just getting stronger while support for the Democrats' political theater has faded.

Undeterred, President Trump keeps racking up victories for the American people, who will respond by resoundingly re-electing him next November."- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
