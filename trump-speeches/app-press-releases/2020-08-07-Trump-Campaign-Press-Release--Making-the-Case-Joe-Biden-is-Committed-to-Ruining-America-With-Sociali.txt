Under President Trump's leadership, the U.S.

economy is on the comeback,adding a record-breaking 1.8 million jobs in July alone.

Meanwhile, Joe Biden and the far-left extremists he strives to please are inviting socialism into America in an attempt to destroy our democracy and economy.

In stark contrast, President Trump honors and upholds American values, built the greatest economy the world has ever seen, and his bold actions have delivered big wins for women and minority communities.

Donald Trump Jr., Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), and Black Voices for Trump Advisory Board Members Diamond and Silk discussed all this and more on tonight's 'Making the Case'hostedby National Chair of Trump Victory Finance Committee Kimberly Guilfoyle.CLICK HERE TO WATCH"While Democrat-run cities are burning to the ground and are overwhelmingly consumed by violence and chaos, the fake news media is covering for their failed leadership," saidDonald Trump Jr."As Joe Biden continues to condone these destructive, unpatriotic actions, President Trump stands with law enforcement, and will always prioritize the safety of the American people.""Our country's future is at stake.
