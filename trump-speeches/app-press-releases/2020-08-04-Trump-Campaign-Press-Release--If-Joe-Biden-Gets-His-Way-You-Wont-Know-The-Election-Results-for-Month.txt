Universal vote-by-mail is a recipe for fraud and chaos.It's been over a month sincevoting endedinNew York's low-turnout, mass vote-by-mail primaryand votersstilldon't know the outcome of two races.

WhilePresident Trump pushes for safe, absentee votingfor those unable to vote in person,Joe Biden and the Democrats are scheming to turn New York's horror story into a national nightmare in November â€“andthe liberal media continues to lie about it.Examples across the country prove thatuniversal, mass mail-in voting would lead to fraud and voter disenfranchisement.

In Pennsylvania,tens of thousands of voterswere unableto cast a ballotdue to mail-in-ballot issues.

In New Jersey's vote-by-mail election,1 in 5 ballots were rejected as fraudulentand countless voters were disenfranchised.In California's primary,more than 100,000 mail-in ballots were rejectedfor a variety of reasons, including postmarking issues and signature mismatches.

Some residents in Patterson, NJ,never received their mail-in ballotsbut were listed as having voted.

In Georgia, a dead catreceived a voter registration application.As the Trump campaign's latest video illustrates, the risks of universal mail-in voting go on and on, but the national liberal media refuses to talk about it.
