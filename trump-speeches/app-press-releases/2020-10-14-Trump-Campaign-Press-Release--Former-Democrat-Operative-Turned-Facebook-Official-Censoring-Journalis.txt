Following the explosive reporting in the New York Post thatJoe Biden lied to the American peopleabout never discussing his son Hunter's corrupt foreign business deals, a Facebook communications official took to social media to declare his intention to purposefully censor the news as obviously harmful to Biden.

Andy Stone, whoseTwitter profiledescribes his work as "Communications, @Facebook," and whoseLinkedIn profiledescribes him as a "Policy Communications Manager" at Facebook, tweeted that he would not link to the Post article and invited fact checkers to attack it.

He also declared his intention to reduce the story's distribution on Facebook.Stone's Twitter profile also lists previous employers, including the Democrats' House Majority PAC, California Democrat Sen.

Barbara Boxer, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Democrat Rep.

Jerry McNerney (CA-9)."Silicon Valley leftists are now openly bragging about interfering with the election to help Joe Biden and undermine President Trump by purposefully censoring journalism in a clear effort to rig the election," said Hogan Gidley, Trump campaign national press secretary.

"The social media giants and tech overlords have already declared themselves to be the sole arbiters of truth, and now they're trying to prevent people from seeing important information that proves Joe Biden was lying to the American people and that he clearly knows about his son's lucrative, corrupt business schemes in foreign countries.

This is election interference, plain and simple."
