"Joe Biden just yesterday indicated he would not send the National Guard into cities and states where left-wing mobs are rioting â€“ in Portland's case, for more than three months.

Last month he issued a written statement specifically about Portland, in which he called the rioters 'peaceful protestors' and accused federal law enforcement officers of 'stoking the fires of division' while the mob was literally setting fire to the federal courthouse.

Following Biden's lead, the leftist mayor of Portland continues to reject President Trump's offer of federal assistance to quell the riots that have now raged for 95 days and resulted in death.

For three months, Joe Biden remained silent on the rampant violence and destruction overtaking Democrat-run cities, where Biden's allies have rejected federal assistance and ordered local police to let rioters run wild.

Biden's campaign even helped bail accused violent criminals out of jail, including a murderer, a rapist, and a rioter who shot at police.

It's obvious that law-abiding Americans will be on their own if Biden and his allies are elected in November.

You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America."- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
