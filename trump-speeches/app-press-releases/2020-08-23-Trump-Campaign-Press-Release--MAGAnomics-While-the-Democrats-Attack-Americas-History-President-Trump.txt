Last week's Democratic National Convention offered an incredibly negative view of the United States and its history, engineered by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to invoke fear and pessimism. President Trump, on the other hand, plans to deliver a message devoted to America's greatness at this week's Republican National Convention, which will uplift viewers and inspire us all. President Trump has always been devoted to cultivating the best of America and making our country great again.
