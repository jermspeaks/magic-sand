Similar to loot boxes, gacha games induce players to spend in-game currency to receive a random virtual item. The in-game currency can be gained by game play, or by purchasing it from the game publisher using real-world funds. Most of these games are free-to-play (F2P) mobile games, where the gacha serves as an incentive to spend real-world money.",True

2023-08-11 09:34:38 AM,b,"rTHIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO FOR HIM NOW:\n\nCount the hs from his last vomit and start with the appropriate instruction from 1 to 5:\n1. Learn to recognize nausea\n-Licking lips\n-Swallowing repeatedly\n-Salivating\n-Staring a fixed spot\n-Panting\n= This means YOUR PET NEEDS FASTING (no food, no water)\n\nIF/WHENEVER HE HAS NAUSEA OR VOMITS YOU NEED TO FAST HIM (NO FOOD, NO WATER) FOR 4 HS AT LEAST  \n\n2. Offer ICE once 2 hs have passed without vomiting: this helps soothe the stomach while hydrating, without causing further vomiting. He can have as much ice as he wants, as long as he doesn´t vomit.\nIf he refuses ice, let him rest, don´t force feed anything.\n\n3. If there are no vomits for 6 hs, offer small amounts of water (tablespoons). Mix 1 big cup of water with 1 teaspoon of sugar and a bit of salt (your pet loses salts within the vomit that need to be replaced). Ideally, you can offer pedialyte or gatorade (the apple flavor)\nIf he tolerates liquids, make sure to keep him hydrated: he needs at least 2 ml per kg of bodyweight every hour – make sure to offer small amounts at a time.\n\n4. If 8 hs go by without him vomiting, you can start offering Ensure (liquid protein supplement from the pharmacy) or Recovery Supplement (from Royal Canin). As always, small amounts at a time, frequently. Start by offering 5 ml every hour, then evaluate his response to give him more (if he is nauseous, reduce the amount or frequency)\n\n5. If he doesn't vomit for 12 hs and has better energy levels you can either:\n- give him wet gastrointestinal food (royal canin or hills) or\n- give him a blend of 50% white rice, 25% chicken and 25 % vegetables (carrots, pumpkin or zucchini). BLEND IT THOROUGHLY until you obtain a soup. Add a bit of salt as well\n\nKeep him on a blended diet until you can reach a vet, but fast him (no food, just water) 8 to 12 hs prior in case your vet needs to image his belly\n\n6. Make him rest and make the room temperature comfortable for him. He shouldn’t waste energy trying to keep his body temperature.\n___________\n\nHOW TO DECIDE WHEN TO GO BACK OR FORTH WITH EACH MENTIONED STEP OF HIS DIET MANAGEMENT:\nAs long as he improves consistently in terms of appetite and energy levels, you can proceed with the next step BUT if he:\n- shows nausea: go back one step\n- vomits: start from scratch and take it slower.\nIf he is nauseous but doesn't vomit, keep him on liquids/ensure as much as needed. \nFeed a soft diet ONLY if he has appetite and start SMALL: it's better for him to be hungry than nauseous. Once he feels better he may drink too much water at once or ask for too much food. DO NOT allow this to happen because this might cause further vomits and this is counter-productive.\nAs long as he doesn't vomit your pet doesn't need to fast: feeding is crucial for your pet to obtain energy to fight infections and dehydration. Once 24 hs have gone by without vomits, your pet may eat as much as he wants.",True

2023-11-20 01:02:38 PM,b,"Hi Sarah, \n\nThank you for sharing your perspective. I am saddened to hear that the confidentiality promised by the OpEd staff was broken, but I am not altogether surprised. I initially did not communicate any concerns with the process and only made an innocent inquiry. It was the staff who pressed me to discuss my experience thus far.\n\nAll that said, I am unsure what Krista communicated, but just to be clear, my initial inquiry has nothing to do with my feelings about the editing process. I have no issue with editing my work (as evidenced by the fact that I've spent a month on this one piece without complaint). I do not find the process itself hard or discouraging - quite the opposite - it's pretty fun! It also has nothing to do with the piece being related to my core beliefs - and thus harder to edit.\n\nTo be blunt, I was unhappy with the pitch and the heavy emphasis on Ukraine, which I felt did not accurately reflect the content. We also discussed the audience for the piece early on, and then it was sent to a far-left magazine - which did not align with our conversation. When I gently pushed back, I did not feel heard. \n\nAll I wanted from Ada and Krista was permission from the Op-Ed project to pitch this particular piece elsewhere on my own. Simple as that. I have no desire to cause a stir nor to continue dwelling on this op-ed. \n\nI am currently swamped and think it would be better to put it away for now. Perhaps one day, I will be inspired to work on it again, but for now, I would rather concentrate on a new project. \n\nAgain, to be clear, my experience with the Op-Ed project is not a reflection of 1) an inability to handle edits and 2) feeling uncomfortable with opinions contrary to my own. I would truly welcome actionable edits as I did not receive any feedback on the structure, which I fear I need help with. \n\nI will try to work on something during my break and have it to you by the weekend. \n\nHappy Thanksgiving!\n\nAll the best,\nMorgan",True

2024-06-25 05:47:08 AM,b,"Feelings\n\nWe say this dog is a preview of what life with a child will be like and I am not feeling confident with what I’m seeing. In fact - it’s creating negative feelings:\n\nYour family as a whole treats animals like dumb objects which they can mock and treat with cruelty, instead of intelligent beings. They set the dog up for failure - feeding him from the table, holding paper or food over his head to make him lunge, putting their hands in his face and then taking it back.\n\nThen once he reacts - as any animal might - they take it as an opportunity to direct criticism at him and by proxy me. Because that IS what they are doing - even that skank feels comfortable joining in - “oh couldn’t happen in my house “ and threatening to hurt him. (Or physically hurting him - your dad kicking him for example when we aren’t looking / peter chasing him to beat him) \n\nThey are implying that I have raised the dog badly. When the truth is they are the ones who are bad pet owners (shocking, hitting, pinching animals) and are crossing boundaries with my dog. \n\n(They do the same things to the kids in the family btw. Ignore the children, have no boundaries or enforced rules, treat them like they’re dumb, set them up for failure by not providing activities or attention to things they’re interested in, and then criticize, shame, and punish them for being children or being misbehaved)\n\nYour reaction is to let them do this and not defend me and yuzu. To lock him in a room that hasn’t been vetted for hazards - all without consulting me. When his failed training is in no small part due to your complete lack of consistency, understanding, or intuitiveness toward dogs.\n\nThis is an experience I could easily see repeated with children. Your family will likely overstimulate and then mock our children, criticize them or use them to criticize me - and I don’t believe you will be brave enough to stand up for us. Because you can’t even do it with the dog.\n\nFast forward to last night:\n\nYou repeat the same behaviors in our house to some extent. You set the dog up to fail and then act dramatic when he bites you. You knew we were going to bed last night, you know the dog is possessive with the yak chews, yet you microwaved it and gave it to him. \n\nThen when he reacted AS WE KNOW HE DOES you act like it’s a shock. Then you made him more agitated - doing things you KNOW will agitate him - and put me in danger of getting bitten. While also using this as an excuse to get whiny, feign frustration, and act like the dog is being bad. \n\nI believe this is a reflection of your family’s belief about dogs. And I worry about what this means for future children.\n\nWill you go against me, undermine me with the children, be inconsistent with the values and rules I wish to teach them, allow people to cross my boundaries as a parent, to criticize them and as a result me?\n\nYou will deny it with your last breath, but I know that if nothing in your behavior changes that is absolutely what will happen. \n\nAnd I can’t help the feelings resulting from this realization. They are in some ways very brutal and intertwined - disgust, apprehension, disappointment, resentment, unsafe and as a result defensive.\n\nYou once told me like you felt I wasn’t an equal partner - a projection that made me snap out of that initial rose colored glasses, lovely dovey feeling. A criticism that made me really zero in on you and your faults.\n\nAnd while I am not so unkind as to repeat that statement to you - this is a glaring issue. \n\n———-\nI want a fellow (dog) parent who is going to get on the same page as me for goals for our pet.\n\nI want a fellow parent who will help me raise the child / dog with the behaviors I think are correct and using positive reinforcement / love - not violence.\n\nI want a fellow parent who will defend us from unjust criticism and boundary crossing - instead of leaving us to fend with it ourselves or to sit there and take it in silence so as not to be seen as trouble makers \n\n————-\n\nI cannot build a positive relationship with your extended family (and you) if you are too weak to protect your immediate family (us), and to uphold boundaries. \n\nIf this isn’t fixed I see it as creating an even bigger invisible barrier between us where I am going one way (disconnecting from our relationship, seeing myself and (dog) children as separate group, having to protect my dog / children from you and your family) and you are going another (falling into the patterns of your extended family). \n\nI don’t want that, but I can’t change you. Only you can choose to be a better man, partner, and parent than they are. \n\nI just need you to know where my mind is at - and how it is affecting our relationship.\n\n",True

2024-07-15 02:08:06 PM,b,"I've been coming to this practice for 2 years. Over that time, I've been very pleased with the treatment my dog received. We had an amazing vet, Dr. Chloe B., who was patient & kind. I loved her. She made my dog feel at ease & we never had any difficulty doing exams or seeking treatment. The staff are amazing!\n\nBut now that our usual vet is gone we've had negative experiences and are growing concerned. We brought my dog in for a rash on his belly. A new vet comes in. She was very impatient with my dog. She told the vet tech to restrain my dog (small) in the air by the neck. This did not go over well.\n\nThen we got a not so nice speech about how THIS type (of breed) is prone to anxiety and how we should always have him sedated because constant negative experiences would make him nervous. Also she said that he needed training (because he supposedly didn't like people touching his ears). Okay, no problem. I told the staff I'd prefer a different doctor next time. Didn't make a fuss.\n\nI went to a certified trainer for re-evaluation (I've spent hundreds of dollars prior making sure my dog was trained since puppyhood). The trainer spent an hour with him and was able to touch his ears, feet, body, mouth, with NO issues whatsoever. She told me signing up for two more months worth of training was a waste, that this dog had no problem with strangers, was good natured, & it sounded like the vet's impatience was the problem.\n\nOnto our most recent visit. I had given my dog the two sedatives the day before as instructed. It was horrific. My normally bright happy dog was completely incapacitated. He nearly fell down the stairs and faced planted multiple times because he couldn't even carry himself. His breathing at one point became erratic. My husband and I were afraid to leave the house and had to cancel all our plans. Trying to get him to use the potty was a nightmare. I decided I was not giving him that dosage again the next day.\n\nI waited **38 minutes** past the appointment time - but we trained with the dog and he was calm.\n\nThe actual visit was 11 minutes in total.\n\nI explained he did NOT like being in a chokehold in the air & it made him go into flight mode. I was told this restraint was SOP and so they were going to use it. Not true BTW - there are multiple vet approved ways to restrain a dog (see footnote 1).\n\nHe could've been restrained on the table so he didn't feel dominated over. But no. Just treated me like I was being precious about my dog.\n\nPredictably it didn't go over well. Their behaviors led to the anxiety I hoped to avoid. They called it quits and put into his notes that he's a reactive dog (he's not) and again pressured me to sedate my dog for the next visit.\n\nI said I wanted to lower the dosage of sedatives and they still pushed to give him two sedatives on the day of the next appointment (overriding my concerns again).\n\nThen they wanted me to sign up for a cleaning. I expressed concerns that I'd read some dogs die as a result of complications of the anesthesia and wanted to know more information (I didn't say I wouldn't do it). The vet tech was very dismissive saying that that didn't happen. That bloodwork could uncover issues. While it IS rare, 1 in 2000 otherwise health dogs dogs DO die (2).\n\nI then tried to inquire whether the person who would be doing the anesthesia was licensed. And she again in a very dismissive tone told me 'they are a vet so..'. That's not what I asked. There are board certified vet anesthesiologists (3). I also didn't know if AVMC allowed vet techs to do it. It wasn't a stupid question - it was an educated one.\n\nAfter these two visits my dog has been traumatized & now he IS nervous about the vet when he wasn't before. I will be trying the 3rd doc in the future, but may have to switch practices if this treatment continues . Very sad - I loved this place.\n\n1) https://vmcli.com/continuing-education/proper-animal-handling-restraint/\n2) https://www.cdhp.org/how-many-dogs-die-from-teeth-cleaning/\n3) https://www.sagecenters.com/services/anesthesiology",True

For example, there was a large paper due near the end of the semester, and professors would often attach the template and instructions to the assignment. However, I couldn't find it, so I emailed her, and she said, 'You're not following the directions or rubric. It can be found under modules. ' Another time I experienced her being passive aggressive was when I came to her after class for assistance on the same paper, I explained to her I do need a better score on the assignment to pass the class and as soon as she looked at my paper, she said 'you're going to reformat this correct?' and I said 'yes' but I thought she responded that in a very condescending tone. Overall, I had anxiety from this course to begin with because it is one of my core classes and the workload is heavy, but it would've supported me if she was more understanding.”",True

He has also completely downplayed our description of the ac damage to the point where it is no longer recognizable and does not represent what we told him. \n\nThe issue is not that the ac doesn't blow cold air. It is that when the car has idled after being driven for a time the ac no longer cools. The cooling function does not kick in again until the car hits 20 mph.
