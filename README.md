# Magic Sand

Magic Sand is my catch-all for projects that have known dependencies that I
want to quickly get up and running.

## Possibilities

- Python projects
- Web Scrapping
- Postgres Setup

We are using bun instead of node. Most JavaScript is written as `.mjs`, unless
we want to write it all using Typescript.

Bun provides an easy to setup server, so we can easily setup the dev server for
our projects.
