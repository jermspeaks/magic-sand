"Based on their performances on stage, the six Democrat candidates demonstrated that not one of them deserves to win the Iowa caucuses in less than three weeks. They will tank the economy, ruin health care, raise taxes, and fail to adequately defend the United States. President Trump would dominate any of them in November."-Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
