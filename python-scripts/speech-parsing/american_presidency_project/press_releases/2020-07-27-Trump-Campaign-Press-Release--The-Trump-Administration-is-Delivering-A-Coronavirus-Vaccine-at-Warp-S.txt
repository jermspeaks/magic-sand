AsDr. Fauci testified, "on January 10th, the sequence was known. On January the 11th, the Vaccine Research Center met to develop a plan. And on the 14th of January, we officially started the vaccine development."Thanks toPresident Trump's Operation Warp Speed, the American people are first in line for a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine—at no cost—as soon as one is developed.Last week, President Trump announced a historic deal with Pfizer to produce at least 100 million doses of a vaccine.

Asthe Trump campaign's latest video makes clear, working together with medical professionals, scientists, and manufacturers, the mass production of a successful vaccine is on track to arrive at record speed.
