That victory confirmed that the law requires observers get meaningful access within six feet of the vote counting in Philadelphia."On the heels of this ruling, Democrats are blatantly defying the law. These Democrats are blocking the doors to the counting center and pushing our observers outside the building while they continue to count votes inside with zero transparency. What are they hiding?"To stop the Democrats from their shady and illegal defiance of the court's order, President Trump's campaign hasfiledsuit in federal court. We are fighting to enforce our observers' constitutional right to due process that Philadelphia County Democrats are blatantly denying."President Trump's team will fight for transparency and accountability as long as it takes to ensure the integrity of the election for the good of Pennsylvania and of the nation."- Justin Clark, Trump 2020 Deputy Campaign Manager and Senior Counsel
