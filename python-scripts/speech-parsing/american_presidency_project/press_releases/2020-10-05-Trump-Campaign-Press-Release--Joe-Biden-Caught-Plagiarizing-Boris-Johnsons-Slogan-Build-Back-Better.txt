For at least the second time in his career, Biden has been caught copying the words of a British politician.If you thought Joe Biden's clunky,tax-and-spendslogan "Build Back Better" sounds like unoriginal, political consultant-speak, you're right. In fact,U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is using the same sloganand was doing so beforeJoe Biden stole itIt's not the first timeBiden's been bustedcopying the words of a British politician. Biden got caught in 1987plagiarizing several linesfrom a campaign speech by British politician Neil Kinnockandlying about coming from a family of coal miners.Biden also had to apologizefor plagiarizing five pages from a law review journal while he was a law student.Back then, Biden's plagiarism scandal sunk his failed presidential campaign.He still hasn't learned from his mistakes.
