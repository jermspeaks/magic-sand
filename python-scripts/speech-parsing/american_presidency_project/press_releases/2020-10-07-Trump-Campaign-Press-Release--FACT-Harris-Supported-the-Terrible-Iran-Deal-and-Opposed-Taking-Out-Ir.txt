Harris won't keep Americans safe.Kamala Harris doesn't know the first thing about keeping Americans safe.Her support for the failed Iran deal and opposition to killing Iran's top terrorist tells the American people all they need to know:After President Trump ordered a strike taking out Qassam Soleimani, an Iranian terrorist with the blood of hundreds of American soldiers on his hands, Harrisattacked President Trump.Harris supported the terrible Iran nuclear deal, which gave billions of dollars to the largest state sponsor of terrorism, endangering American lives, and putting America's ally Israel at greater risk.Just like Joe Biden, Harris would be weak against terrorism and America's enemies.Biden's failed foreign policy made the world more dangerous:Bidencalledthe disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal a "good deal" for the U.S., Israel, and our Arab allies even though the deal put Iranon the pathto a nuclear weapon.Biden secretly shipped Iranpallets of unmarked cashandlet Iran get awaywith taking Americans hostage.Biden said that President Trump's decision to eliminate Iranian terrorist Qasem Soleimaniwas a mistakethat amounted to "tossing a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox." Biden's prediction did not come true.After President Trump brought Soleimani to justice, Biden falsely claimed "we could be on the brink of a major conflict across the Middle East." Biden's prediction did not come true.Biden said President Trump's decision to withdrawfrom the failed Iran dealwould make war more likely. In fact, Iran is weaker and more isolated than ever, and President Trump is brokering historic peace deals between Israel and Arab countries in the region.Now,President Trump iscleaning up Biden's Iran mess.In stark contrast to Biden's failures and Harris's disastrous agenda, President Trump's foreign policy strengthened America's national security, made Israel safer,advanced the cause of peace in the Middle East, andbrought countries in the region together in opposition to Iran.
