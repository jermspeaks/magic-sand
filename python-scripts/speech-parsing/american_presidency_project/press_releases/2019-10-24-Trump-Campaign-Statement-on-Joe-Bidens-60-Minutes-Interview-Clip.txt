"Joe Biden is correct on one point: Hunter Biden would never have an office in the White House because he's proven that his only qualification is being the son of Joe Biden. Jared Kushner, meanwhile, paved the way for landmark criminal justice reform while Joe Biden authored the notorious Clinton Crime Bill. Jared helped land the 2028 Olympics for Los Angeles while Biden whiffed on an Olympic bid for Chicago. Jared was a leader in crafting the USMCA trade deal while Biden championed the job-killing NAFTA disaster. And Jared, the grandson of Holocaust survivors, was instrumental in moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Ivanka Trump, in her own right, has proven herself to be an accomplished CEO and has made historic strides for women. Among her achievements are doubling the child tax credit, retraining 14 million American workers, and starting the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative."- Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager
