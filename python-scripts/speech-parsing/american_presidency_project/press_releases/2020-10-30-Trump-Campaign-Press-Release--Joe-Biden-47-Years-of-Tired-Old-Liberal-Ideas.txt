Joe Biden has spent 47 years in Washington supporting disastrous policies that hollowed out the American heartland, hurt working families, and empowered the Chinese Communist Party. Throughout his entire career, Joe Biden has consistently put the interests of the Washington D.C. swamp and pursuit of personal wealth above the needs of the American people. Now, Biden has embraced the radical agenda of his party's left-wing base and plans on implementing drastic tax hikes and harsh regulations, demolishing any hope of economic recovery. The American people cannot afford four years of Joe Biden's agenda- they have already suffered through 47 years of his failure.Click here to watch "47 Years of Failure"
