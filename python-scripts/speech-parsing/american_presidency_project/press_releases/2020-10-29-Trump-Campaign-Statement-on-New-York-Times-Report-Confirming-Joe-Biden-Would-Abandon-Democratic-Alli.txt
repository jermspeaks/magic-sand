Trump Campaign Senior Advisor Mercedes Schlapp issued the following statement regardingThe New York Times reporton Joe Biden's policy toward Venezuela:"The stunning admission by Joe Biden's top advisors that, if elected, Biden would betray the people of Venezuela in their fight for freedom and kneel before their brutal dictatorship is appalling, but not surprising. Biden has spent decades bowing to socialist regimes across Latin America. Unlike Joe Biden, who would actively work to prolong the suffering of the Venezuelan people, President Trump will always stand for freedom, democracy, and human rights. Joe Biden should be ashamed of himself, but he has no shame and no one who wants freedom for Venezuela should vote for him."
