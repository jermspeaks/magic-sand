On the 78th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral and Veterans for Trump Advisory Board Member Don Loren issued the following statement:"Seventy-eight years ago, our country was awakened to death and destruction in our homeland. As we remember the more than 2,400 Americans killed in this attack, we also salute every veteran who served in World War II. We are eternally grateful for the sacrifices of those whose courage and resolve preserved our freedoms and way of life."
