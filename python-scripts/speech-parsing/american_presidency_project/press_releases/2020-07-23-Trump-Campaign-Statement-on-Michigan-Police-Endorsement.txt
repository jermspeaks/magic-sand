President Donald J. Trump's re-election campaign today issued the following statement regarding the strong endorsement of the President by the Police Officers Association of Michigan:"Joe Biden has caved in to the 'Defund the Police' movement and has turned his back on the Thin Blue Line â€“ and police officers have noticed. As Democrats in cities across the nation allow their communities to burn and let violence erupt against local law enforcement, President Trump defends and stands with our heroes as they preserve and protect our neighborhoods. Meanwhile Biden calls the rioters 'peaceful protesters' and accuses law enforcement of stoking the 'fires of division.' Over and over, Biden sides with the rioters and against police, reinforcing the fact that you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America."- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
