"These new revelations about the FBI's pervasive corruption and extreme politicization on Joe Biden's watch should send shockwaves through our country and the mainstream media.Newly revealed text messagesshow that FBI agents knew in 2016 what their superiors were doing to Donald Trump and his team was wrong and potentially criminal.Newly declassified informationshows that FBI leadership knew in 2016 they were using a bogus dossier manufactured by a former British spy and a suspected Russian agent, but they went ahead with their politically motivated operation to frame the president for collusion anyway. Joe Biden was at the center of this plot, and itappears he directed the FBIto target decorated veteran Michael Flynn with the Logan Act. Anunmasking requesttargeting Flynn was also madein Biden's nameon January 12, 2017, the same day that information wasillegally leakedto The Washington Post. Biden has never been forced to explain these facts and answer for his role in ensuring President Trump did not enjoy a peaceful transition of power in 2017. Reporters who spent years pushing Russian disinformation should do their job and make Biden answer for what his administration did, which amounts to the biggest abuse of power in American political history."- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
