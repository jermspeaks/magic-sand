"The Democrats have hit a new low in their quest to impeach President Trump. They've now had a hearing where the only 'witnesses' were the committee lawyers from previous hearings. No wonder Americans are rejecting this for the sham that it is."- Kayleigh McEnany, Trump 2020 national press secretary
