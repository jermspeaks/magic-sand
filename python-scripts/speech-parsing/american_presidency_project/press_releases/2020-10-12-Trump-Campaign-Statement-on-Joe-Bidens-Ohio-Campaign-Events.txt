"President Trump won Ohio convincingly in 2016 and will do so again in November, so we are thrilled to see Joe Biden wasting a valuable day on the campaign trail visiting a state he cannot win. President Trump has a clear record of building a strong Ohio economy before the global pandemic was unleashed by China, and he's already doing it a second time. Joe Biden's record on the economy is a disaster and includes voting for NAFTA and putting China's interests ahead of America's, with Ohio workers paying the price. Biden's proposed $4 trillion tax increase and his embrace of the Green New Deal would decimate the Ohio economy and destroy 700,000 fracking jobs in the state. Ohio voters know that President Trump has accomplished more in 47 months than Joe Biden has in 47 years."- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
