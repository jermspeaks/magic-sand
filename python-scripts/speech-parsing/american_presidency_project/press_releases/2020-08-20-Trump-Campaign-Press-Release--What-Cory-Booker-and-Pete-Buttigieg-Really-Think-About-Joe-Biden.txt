Booker said Biden "is not doing a good job at bringing folks together."Far-left Democrats like Pete Buttigieg and Cory "Spartacus" Booker know Joe Biden is weak and diminishedâ€”they all but said it outright during the primary. They also know Biden has poor judgement and isn't very good at bringing people together.Buttigiegarguedthat voters should "absolutely" question Biden's decision-making capacity, saying Biden's "years spent in Washington" did not equate to good "judgement."ButtigiegslammedBiden's vote for the Iraq War, saying he "supported the worst foreign policy decision made by the United States in my lifetime."Buttigieg said he would not have allowed Hunter Biden to sit on the board of a corrupt Ukrainian gas company while Joe Biden was VP. So why did Joe?BookercalledBiden the "architect of mass incarceration" for authoring the 1994 crime bill. BookersaidBiden doesn't have the "courage" to own up to it.BookerlambastedBiden for using the term "gangbanger" to describe young Black men, saying Biden was "not doing a good job at bringing folks together... He's causing a lot of frustration and even pain with his words."Booker asked Biden to apologize forbragging about his relationships with racist segregationists, but Biden refused. "Apologize for what?" Bidenresponded. "Cory should apologize. He knows better."Booker questioned Biden's cognitive abilities, saying sometimes you watch Biden and"you just wonder."Those are their words, not ours.
