"President Trump is leading the nation through the coronavirus crisis, but Joe Biden has decided to fill the role of the opposition, ineffectively sniping from the sidelines, stumbling through television interviews, and hoping for relevance and political gain. Americans are facing a public health emergency and are worried about their jobs and the economy, but Joe Biden's record and proposals prove that he is ill-suited for a role in this fight. While he was vice president, he oversaw the most sluggish economic recovery this country has seen since World War II. He supported disastrous, job-killing trade deals like NAFTA and TPP and his proposal to enact the economy-strangling Green New Deal as a response to this crisis is about the worst remedy imaginable. On top of that, Biden has pledged to eliminate the Trump tax cuts, which cut taxes for the vast majority of American taxpayers. Meanwhile, President Trump has been hard at work, negotiating the relief package for unemployed workers and affected businesses and leading in this time of crisis. The President's policies drove the American economy to the greatest heights in half a century, and he is the best person to lead us through this difficult period."- Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director
