"Pennsylvania voters won a great victory today to protect election integrity. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed a left-wing challenge to the state's election rule for mail-in ballots, which sought to allow ballots to be counted days after Election Day. President Trump continues to champion what should be a non-partisan issue to protect our free and fair elections. Yet, the Democrat-led leftist efforts only continue to try to remove safeguards from elections across America. We believe the resolution in this case is a very good sign and a victory for the people of Pennsylvania to protect their important voice at the ballot box."- Jenna Ellis, Trump 2020 Senior Legal Adviser
