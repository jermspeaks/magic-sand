Biden will eliminate fracking. It's a matter of when, not if.There is no question that Pennsylvania fracking workers will be decimated if Joe Biden is elected.It's just a matter of when, not if, those workers will lose their jobs. Yet Biden told another lie about his position on fracking during an interview in Pittsburgh when he claimed that he has "never told the environmentalists that I'm going to ban fracking. Period."This is demonstrably false. Biden has told far-left activists onat least four occasionsthat he dreams about ending fracking and eliminating fossil fuels:"What about, say, stopping fracking?" anactivist asked Biden in January. "Yes!" Biden replied enthusiastically."Yes! Exactly!"When an activisttold Biden in Decemberthat he "would love to" ban fracking, Biden replied"I'd love to, too. I'd love to make sure we can't use any oil or gas. Period. Now.""Look in my eyes," Bidensolemnly tolda young woman last year."I guarantee we're going to end fossil fuel.""Wearegoing to get rid of fossil fuels,"Bidentold a crowdof activists at an event in New Hampshire in February.Biden has alsosaid multiple times in debatesthat he would eliminate fossil fuels. Hundreds of thousands of fracking and natural gas jobs in Pennsylvania – and millions of American energy jobs across the country – are on the chopping block in a Biden presidency.It's not a matter of if. It's a matter of when.
