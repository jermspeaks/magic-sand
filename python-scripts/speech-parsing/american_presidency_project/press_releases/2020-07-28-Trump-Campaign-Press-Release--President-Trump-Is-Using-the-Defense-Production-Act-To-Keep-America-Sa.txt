The administration has used the DPA more than 30 times to combat the coronavirus.President Trump continues to leverage a historicpublic-private partnershipto combat the coronavirus pandemic—an effort made stronger by theannouncementtoday that Kodak will begin producing critical pharmaceutical ingredients at its New York facilities under the Defense Production Act (DPA).This is just the latestexampleof the Trump Administration'suse of the Defense Production Actto drive supply chainsbackto the United States after decades of reliance on foreign manufacturing—and bring American jobs back with them.The President has invoked the Defense Production Act more than 30 times, helping secure critical supplies ofventilators, personal protective equipment, testing supplies, and more.That hasn't stopped Biden from spreading disinformation and pretending President Trump is refusing to use the Defense Production Act—a straight up lie. Biden claimed he had been calling for the Defense Production Act "for weeks" before the president. The reality? "Biden's statement came just minutes after Trump first said he would invoke the DPA,"according to fact checkers.It's not the only lie about the coronavirus Biden has been caught in.Biden claims he wrote the "playbook" to combat pandemics, but Biden's real record isa shortage of masks, a botched vaccine rollout, and a halt in testing.When the President took action to save American jobs,Biden tried to undermine the successof the Paycheck Protection Program. Biden evenliedabout "warning" the country about the virus.Never forget: Joe Bidenspent his entire careerpursuing bad trade deals that drove American manufacturing overseas and bled American supply chains dry—andPresident Trump is cleaning up his mess.Thanks to the leadership of the Trump Administration, the United States currentlyleads the worldin coronavirus testing and the development of a vaccine is proceedingat record speed. Amid an unprecedented global pandemic,President Trump is making sure we have the resources we need to combat the virus at home.
