Trump campaign releases second set of illegally cast ballots from dead voters; Americans should have confidence their votes are not rendered meaningless due to illegally cast votes by scheming fraudsters.The American people deserve a free, fair, and fully transparent election in which every legal ballot is counted and every illegal ballot is not counted.Having confidence in our elections means knowing that votes are legally cast and that voters themselves are legally eligible to cast a ballot.Americans cannot have confidence in election results unless elected officials, law enforcement authorities, and fair-minded journalists take the issue of voter fraud seriously and investigate potential instances thoroughly. The Trump campaign willcontinue to bring these allegations to light, andthe media and election authorities should vigorously examine them.Here are several examples in Pennsylvania that should be investigated:Voter records show someone used the identity ofJohn H. Granahan of Allentown, Pennsylvaniato vote in the recent election, even though Granahan died in May 2019. TheDusckas Martin Funeral Home and Crematoryran an obituary of Granahan's death when he passed away.Judy Presto of Southpark, Pennsylvaniadied in 2013, but someone registered her to vote in September 2020 and cast a ballot under her name in last week's election. ThePittsburgh Post-Gazettepublished an obituary after Presto's passing announcing her death.Elizabeth Bartman of Drexel Hill, Pennsylvaniais shown as having registered to vote in September 2020 and cast a ballot in last week's election,even though shedied in 2008. ThePhiladelphia Inquirerran an obituary after Bartman's passing.These victims of voter fraud deserve justice, and legal voters should be able to have confidence that their votes are not rendered meaningless due to illegally cast votes.
