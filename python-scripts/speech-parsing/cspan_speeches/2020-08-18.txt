Host: DEBORAH AND CANTON GEORGIA FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP THREE SHE SPOKE ABOUT JONATHAN NIESE LAKE CRISTINA MARCOS AND JOHN MILLER TO GO TO THE HILL WEB SITE THEY HAVE A STORY BY THINGS TO KNOW ON THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM. JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS POINT NUMBER WHEN THEY MAKE IS NOT EVERY DEMOCRAT IS BACK IN THE PLATFORM. WERE SHE TO TOLEDO OF MICHIGAN PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THEY WOULD VOTE AGAINST THEIR PLATFORM SAYING IT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH IN OVERHAULING THE U.S. HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WITH A GOAL OF ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. THEY ALSO SAY THE PLATFORM PAPERS OVER SOME DIFFERENCES ADDING DEMOCRATS TRIED TO STRIKE A BALANCE FOR CONVENTION TO FEATURE BOTH A FORMER REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR JOHN KASICH AND ALEXANDRIA OCASIO CORTEZ. I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO THE FIRST-GENERATION UNITED STATES CITIZEN. HIS PARENTS IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY. HE DOES A GREAT JOB. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU GUYS. I RECEIVE IT. I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE BUT I'M GOING TO ADD A LITTLE TWIST TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE ADDED SO MY SPEECH IS GOING TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR SOME OF THE HUGE SHOUT OUT TO ALL THOSE LATINOS BECAUSE YOU ARE OUT THERE MAKING YOURSELVES HEARD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [CHANTING] FOUR MORE YEARS. FOUR MORE YEARS. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] I CHOSE TO COME UP HERE AND SPEAK IN SPANISH BECAUSE I'M SICK AND TIRED OF PEOPLE THROWING AROUND THE RACE CARD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] I'M SICK AND TIRED OF LATINOS NOT HEARING THE TRUTH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] DO WE WANT A PRESIDENT THAT HIS FIRST PRIORITIES ARE HIS COUNTRY? THE ANSWER SHOULD ALWAYS BE YES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S NOT A BOUT RACE. DANCE OR IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE DULY ONE OF RESIDENT THAT WANTS TO SECURE OUR NATION'S BORDERS FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE OR DO WE WANT A PRESIDENT THAT WANTS TO ALLOW DESTRUCTION OF OUR LIVES BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS? AGAIN I WILL REPEAT IT IS NOT ABOUT RACE. STOP USING THE RACE CARD AND START USING THE TRUMP CARD. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOD BLESS AMERICA, GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP, GOD BLESS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU GUYS HERE TODAY AND GOD BLESS THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE OUT THERE PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE EVERYDAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] C HE STOLE MY THUNDER EARLIER BUT I WAS GOING TO TRANSLATE THAT FOR YOU BROKE WITH IT WHAT HE SAID WAS FOUR MORE YEARS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT'S TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP. THAT'S ALL YOU NEEDED TO KNOW. THERE HAS BEEN A PLACE THAT I'D RATHER BE THAN LOOKING FORWARD. I CAN'T WAIT TO BE AT THE VICTORY CELEBRATION BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO DEFEAT JOE BIDEN. [APPLAUSE] HE IS GOING TO DEFEAT THE DEMOCRAT ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE SECOND TIME. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF MY LIFETIME. WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ARE A GREAT MANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND JOE BIDEN COULD I TAKE , LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO HIGHLIGHT JUST A FEW AND I'M GOING TO SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE. IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA CONTROL OF U.S. IMMIGRATION LAW WILL BE CEDED TO MULTINATIONAL CRIMINAL CARTEL. IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA WOMEN AND CHILDREN WILL PUT THEMSELVES IN THE HANDS OF DANGEROUS SMUGGLING ORGANIZATIONS WHO ABUSE AND AT TIMES MURDER. IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA ORGANIZED CRIME WILL BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE WITH IMPUNITY WHILE AN INNOCENT LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS SUFFER. IN JOE BIDEN'S AMERICA U.S. BORDERS WILL BE NOTHING BUT A MASK. CHAOS WILL REIGN ON OUR BORDERS. INTEL JOE BIDEN LEFT OFFICE AS VICE PRESIDENT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION INSTITUTED A POLICY IN WHICH BORDER PATROL AGENTS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY INTO CUSTODY AND LESS THEY WERE HERE FOR A YEAR AND THEY DIDN'T REQUIRE ANY PROOF. ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS TELL ORDER PATROL AGENTS THAT THEY WERE HERE FOR ONE YEAR. PRESIDENT TRUMP , I'M SORRY. LAWLESSNESS ON THE BORDER CRIMINAL CARTELS WEREN'T RIDGED. ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS LOOK AT PORTLAND OREGON, SEATTLE WASHINGTON, CHICAGO ILLINOIS AND NEW YORK CITY TO SEE THE LAWLESSNESS THAT WILL HAPPEN IF JOE BIDEN'S POLICIES ARE ALLOWED TO BE IMPLEMENTED. PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THE OTHER HAND IS THE POLAR OPPOSITE HAS DONE EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER AND CONTINUES TO DO EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY SAFE BECAUSE HE LOVES THIS COUNTRY AND HE LOVES THE CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY. [APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP NOT ONCE BUT TWICE CUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE TARGETED THE CARTEL AT THEIR SOURCE AND WENT AFTER THE DRUGS THAT DIRECTLY COME INTO THE UNITED STATES AND KILL OUR YOUTH AND ADULTS ALIKE. HE HAS DONE WHAT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE US SAFE. IN THE EARLY PART OF 2016 AND ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNSEL I ENDORSE PRESIDENT TRUMP A POTENTIAL ALONE. TODAY I AM HERE ENDORSING PRESIDENT TRUMP ON BEHALF OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL, THE TRUE BORDER SECURITY EXPERTS. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT POTENTIAL ANYMORE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ACTUAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS. I CAN'T LIST ALL THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HAD BUT I WILL LIST TWO THINGS THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THESE MEN AND WOMEN RIGHT HERE. HE HAS DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT TO SECURE OUR BORDERS. HE HAS ALSO BUILT THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN MY LIFETIME, AND ECONOMY, AN ECONOMY THAT SERVES US ALL AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT SERVES OUR CHILDREN. I HAVE COME TO NOTE PRESIDENT TRUMP PERSONALLY AND FROM EXPERIENCE I KNOW HOW MUCH HE CARES ABOUT ALL OF YOU. I KNOW HE DOES WHAT HE DOES FOR THE LOVE OF COUNTRY. IN 47 YEARS AS A GROOMED POLITICIAN JOE BIDEN HAS NOTHING BUT RHETORIC. IN THREE AND A HALF SHORT YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ACCOMPLISHED THEM. [APPLAUSE] I AM CONFIDENT IN MY FELLOW CITIZENS ON NOVEMBER 3 WHEN WE ARE ALL SITTING IN THAT AL AT TALKS WITH ALL OF THE NOISE IS BEHIND US, WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THOSE ACCOMPLISHMENTS I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL ELECT THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS THE COURAGE TO PUT AMERICA FIRST. THAT IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP. [APPLAUSE] I'D LIKE TO KNOW OF HIM TO THE STAGE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.

THAT'S A BIG DEAL AND THEY ARE GREAT FRIENDS OF MINE AND WE ARE DELVING , NEXT WEEK WE WILL BE UP TO 300 MILES OF INCREDIBLE WALL. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND OUR NUMBERS ARE THE BEST. WE ARE VERY TOUGH ON THE BORDER WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO COME IN. WE ARE NOT GOING TO HURT OUR FARMERS BUT WE ARE A LITTLE BIT OVER 280 MILES RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE NEVER BEEN HELP LIKE THIS WALL. THERE ARE TWO THINGS, AND 1000 YEARS YOU CAN COME BACK. THE TECHNOLOGY IS OBSOLETE BEFORE YOU CAN PUT IN THE BOX BUT TWO THINGS NEVER GET OLD. WHEELS AND WALLS. IF YOU COME BACK IN 1000 YEARS HE WILL SAY WE STILL HAVE WHEELS AND WALLS AND THAT'S THE ONLY THING YOU WILL RECORD NICE.

THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE BORDERS THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE SANCTUARY CITIES, LOTS OF BAD THINGS THEY WANT FOLLOWING ORDERS FROM HIS BOSS BUT I GUESS HIS NEW BOSSES BERNIE SANDERS. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? CRAZY BERNIE. JOE BIDEN HAS PLEDGED OBAMA'S IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT TO PROVIDE FREE GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE AND YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO GIVE IT TO ILLEGAL ALIENS. YOU DON'T GET IT. YOU DON'T GET IT. SHE'LL VIOLENT CRIMINAL ALIENS. THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND GIVE EVERY ILLEGAL ALIEN ON THE PLANET EARTH OR FREE TICKET TO INVENT AN ASYLUM GAME AUTOMATIC ADMISSION INTO OUR COUNTRY. WE WILL HAVE PEOPLE COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY THAT NEVER EVENT OUT OF IT BEFORE GREEDY GET FREE EDUCATION, YOU GET FREE HEALTH CARE WHY WOULDN'T THEY COME? LET'S GO TO AMERICA. BIDEN PLAN WOULD UNLEASH A FLOOD OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION LIKE THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN. IT'S CRAZY.
