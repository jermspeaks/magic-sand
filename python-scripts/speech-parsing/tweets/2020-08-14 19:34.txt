RT @RepLeeZeldin: With a straight face, Biden just said President Trump has been coddling terrorists around the world.🧐After Biden advised AGAINST taking out Bin Laden, now he’s ignoring that it was Pres. Trump who had Soleimani &amp; al-Baghdadi killed, the ISIS caliphate eliminated, and far more.
