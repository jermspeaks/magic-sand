RT @SenatorTimScott: Through yesterday, the PPP approved 22,933 loans for more than $3.8b in South Carolina. $3.8b to ensure workers get their paycheck and businesses can stay open. Also yesterday, Democrats decided that's enough, we're fine with no more PPP funding. Irresponsible and unacceptable.
