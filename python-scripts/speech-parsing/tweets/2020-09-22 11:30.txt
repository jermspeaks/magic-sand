RT @SenJohnThune: Despite the Dem-led misinformation campaign, filling this SCOTUS seat follows historical Senate norms. There is a different precedent if you have a divided government (2016) vs. having the same party in control in the WH &amp; Senate (now). In fact, Joe Biden made the distinction. https://t.co/qdud4JJUq8
