RT @jpsal123: @JillBernadette3 @edhenry Sorry Jill, I like Ed Henry but his question implied that the transcript specifically said “dig up dirt.” That’s the trigger word, “dirt.” It was never said. It’s misleading. You should read the transcript. It said “look into” and “WITH the Attorney General.”
