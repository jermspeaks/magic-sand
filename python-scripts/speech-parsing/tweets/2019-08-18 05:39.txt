RT @TeamTrump: MUST WATCH:  Massive overflow crowd outside of @realDonaldTrump's rally in New Hampshire chants 'Four More Years!' &amp; 'USA!' while watching the president speak.  For the HATERS, 'overflow' is the area outside a packed arena where people who can't get in can watch on screens! https://t.co/k83a7yAB5W
