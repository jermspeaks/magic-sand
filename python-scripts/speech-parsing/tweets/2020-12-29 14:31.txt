RT @RepAndyBiggsAZ: Today, I voted to defend President @realDonaldTrump's veto of the NDAA because it serves foreign interests, not American interests.   President Trump has always been a staunch advocate of our troops, and sadly, this bill does not prioritize them or our nation's future. https://t.co/8M2Ukk3ATn
