RT @OliverMcGee: Retweet @POTUS’ PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT on TRADE!  As @SpeakerPelosi spent $5K on Gold Pens to sign an Impeachment Hoax, @realDonaldTrump used a $1.99 Sharpie Pen to sign a $200B China Trade Deal, adding to 7M JOBS the @WhiteHouse created in 3 years that @BarackObama didn’t! https://t.co/ogb7kXSRJO
