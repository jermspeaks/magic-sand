RT @MrAndyNgo: This is the reality of being a journalist who accurately covers antifa.  Law enforcement has been informed. @Twitter should do its part by helping police identify people who send these anonymous threats. @uspresstracker, step up &amp; condemn antifa assaults &amp; threats on press. https://t.co/hKomwHX0nO
