RT @NHC_Atlantic: Beyond Hurricane #Dorian and TS #Gabrielle, we're monitoring 3 other disturbances with a low chance of becoming tropical cyclones during the next 2 days. A disturbance over the far eastern Atlantic has a medium chance of development during the next 5 days. https://t.co/QnemzQ1V2D https://t.co/pgm5Ic3jWJ
