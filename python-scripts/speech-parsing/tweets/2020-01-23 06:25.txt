RT @SenJohnBarrasso: Today on @NBCNews, I discussed how @SpeakerPelosi sat on the articles of impeachment for 33 days. America has seen this trial for what it is: political stunt. Itâ€™s not just about overturning the last election of @realDonaldTrump but going after the next one, too. https://t.co/6Bn4HqoEmL
