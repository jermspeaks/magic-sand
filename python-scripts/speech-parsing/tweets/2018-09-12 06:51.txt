RT @WhiteHouse: .@realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS visited the Flight 93 National Memorial in Pennsylvania this morning to honor the memories of nearly 3,000 precious lives lost on September 11, 2001, as well as every hero who has given their life since that day to protect our safety and freedom. https://t.co/RKwcvO7vh9
