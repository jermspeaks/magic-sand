RT @BernardKerik: .@tedwheeler Portland is your responsibility, not President @realDonaldTrump’s! You have allowed #BLM and #Antifa militants to control your city for more than 100 days! You’ve done nothing about it! You’ve refused help from the federal government! That killing is your fault! https://t.co/ddYLNcwdbb
