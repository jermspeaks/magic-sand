RT @WhiteHouse: On June 6, 1944, our Greatest Generation bravely stormed the beaches of Normandy.  'Those who fought here won a future for our nation. They won the survival of our civilization. And they showed us the way to love, cherish, and defend our way of life for many centuries to come.' https://t.co/XbrWIkXFfl
