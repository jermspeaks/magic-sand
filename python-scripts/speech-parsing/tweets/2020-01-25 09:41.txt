RT @SenateGOP: Conference Chairman @SenJohnBarrasso:  Adam Schiff says he doesn't trust the voters.  He didn't trust them in 2016 and doesn't trust them in 2020.  Which is why he doesn't want to just remove @realdonaldtrump from office...  He also wants to remove him from the ballot in 2020. https://t.co/unHuV2x5TP
