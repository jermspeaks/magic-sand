RT @EliseStefanik: Today we heard from Amb. Sondland that @realdonaldtrump told him: “No quid pro quo. I want nothing.”   No evidence of impeachable offenses, but the partisan process continues.   And Adam Schiff still won’t let us call the whistleblower or Hunter Biden to testify. https://t.co/LAfwofDMQ3
