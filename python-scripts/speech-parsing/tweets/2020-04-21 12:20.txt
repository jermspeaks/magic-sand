RT @JimInhofe: Our farmers and ranchers are instrumental to Oklahoma’s economy and they’ve been hit hard by #COVID19. This funding will bring some much needed relief and provide certainty for Oklahoma ag producers. I am proud of @realDonaldTrump's continued dedication to our farmers. https://t.co/25xPEctPX0
