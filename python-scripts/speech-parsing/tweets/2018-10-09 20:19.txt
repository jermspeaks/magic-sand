RT @NWSTallahassee: 8am Intermediate Advisory from @NHC_Atlantic upgrades #HurricaneMichael into a category 2 hurricane. Keep in mind, wind (which the categories are based on) will NOT be the only impacts with this storm. Expect life-threatening storm surge along much of the Gulf Coast, and more. https://t.co/wuPnEQ9hkE
