RT @SenateGOP: Chairman @SenJohnBarrasso:  60% of Americans say they are financially better off now than they were a year ago.  And over 70% believe that they will be *even better* off a year from now.  90% say their personal life is better.  That is the kind of optimism that tells a story. https://t.co/WfnN6BkFt6
