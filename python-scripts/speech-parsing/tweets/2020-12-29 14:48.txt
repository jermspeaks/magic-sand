RT @RepJohnJoyce: While I support many provisions of the NDAA, I respect our Commander-in-Chief’s calls to make it even stronger for our men &amp; women in uniform. Alongside @realDonaldTrump,I’ll keep fighting to support the warfighter, bolster our strong national defense, &amp; equip our Armed Forces.
