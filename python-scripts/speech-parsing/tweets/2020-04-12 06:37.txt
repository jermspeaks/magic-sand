RT @robertjeffress: During our 152-year history in downtown Dallas Presidents Woodrow Wilson, Gerald Ford, &amp; George H. W. Bush have worshipped at @firstdallas. We are honored that tomorrow President @realDonaldTrump will be the first @POTUS to worship with us live online. Welcome, President Trump!
