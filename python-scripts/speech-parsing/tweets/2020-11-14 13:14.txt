RT @LeeSmithDC: Exactly. For more than 4 years, FBI, Dems, &amp; press have tried to disenfranchise Trump voters. The idea half the country should fold because media that targeted Trump since 2016 says so is a sinister joke. Head up, chin down, move forward Team America. The rest of you, suck eggs. https://t.co/SoN0IK7WD6
