RT @robjh1: The liberal media &amp; Dems don’t want the election called the night of the election. They want a few extra days to massage the numbers, so they are planting the seed now that voters won’t know. Ordinarily they’d hold officials accountable for not being prepared.  #MailInBallots https://t.co/dBQsE75WIW
