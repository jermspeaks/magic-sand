RT @GOPChairwoman: From Day 1, Gretchen Whitmer has been too focused on politics.  Case in point: She just claimed she is “not getting involved in what’s happening” with Dems censuring Rep. Whitsett.  If that’s true, why is Whitmer punishing her for saying something positive about @realDonaldTrump?
