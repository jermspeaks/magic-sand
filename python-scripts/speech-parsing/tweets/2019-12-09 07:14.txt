RT @SteveScalise: Every scam Dems have run against @realDonaldTrump—from Mueller to bribery—has failed.  They have no case for impeachment.  Public opinion has turned against their games.  But they're panicked Trump will get re-elected. So they're rushing political impeachment.  It's all politics. https://t.co/TMMuh7gN3U
