RT @paulsperry_: How has President Trump not gone completely off the rails &amp; ballistic by now? Everyone in Washington is against the man. Every waking hour he is taking flak &amp; enemy fire, from all sides. Yet he hangs in there. Maintains composure. Trump must have nerves of steel. How's he do it?
