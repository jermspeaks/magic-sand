RT @NWSColumbia: [Sep 5, 1`:25 PM] - Winds are picking back up @NOAABuoyData #41004, 47 miles SE from Charleston as #Dorian's eye moves away towards the NNE. Current pix show birds trapped in the eye. Waves will rebuild as the  eyewall again approaches. https://t.co/GUkeGEucKu #scwx #caewx https://t.co/tI8XOmwRqX
