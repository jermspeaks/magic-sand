RT @KayaJones: Here’s my grandparents &amp; great grandparents. They are rolling in their graves at the hatred that still exists. I’m biracial &amp; I am a Christian who supports our country &amp; our President. We are all children of God. Don’t let people make you think we’ve not always been hand in hand. https://t.co/BfuZvPDXTp
