RT @JudgeJeanine: The democrats are tearing this country apart. They are wusses, wimps and weasels. They don’t have the chutzpah to face Donald Trump in November, I don’t blame them. Because he'll blow those wusses, wimps and weasels right out of the swampy water they call home.  #OpeningStatement https://t.co/nQSsXvV0U2
