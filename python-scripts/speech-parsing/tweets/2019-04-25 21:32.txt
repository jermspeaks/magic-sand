RT @RepMarkMeadows: We knew they wouldn’t give up.  The collusion delusion fell flat, and now reports say House Democrats are preparing to “ramp up” their investigations of President Trump.   Not “move on”—“ramp up.” They’re doubling down. This is a myopic obsession with politically targeting POTUS.
