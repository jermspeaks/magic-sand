RT @johncatsjr: Trump Economy vs Obama Economy  Manufacturing jobs created: Trump: 470,000 Obama: -206,000  Under Obama, unemployment declined off recession highs BUT labor participation fell 3%   Under Trump, participation has increased &amp; unemployment has decreased!  Get Americans back to work!
