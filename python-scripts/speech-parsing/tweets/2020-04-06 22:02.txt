RT @realDonaldTrump: Advertising in the Failing New York Times is WAY down. Washington Post is not much better. I canâ€™t say whether this is because they are Fake News sources of information, to a level that few can understand, or the Virus is just plain beating them up. Fake News is bad for America!
