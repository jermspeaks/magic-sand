RT @RepDougCollins: After Dems denied the #BorderCrisis for months, Nadler today claims there's 'child abuse' &amp; 'negligent homicide &amp; systematic torture of children at the border.‚Äù It's incredible Dems oppose efforts to end the crisis, then misrepresent it &amp; blame shift when @POTUS offers solutions. https://t.co/jWU4l8kSkj
