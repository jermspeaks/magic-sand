RT @SharylAttkisson: I read that Trump rally was rambling/half-empty. I also read the opposite. I like to watch candidates' rallies myself  so I can see... without the spin. I did so in 2016-16. It's not entirely why I predicted (starting in 15) Trump would win, but it was part of the picture. https://t.co/i3j8y9KgKn
