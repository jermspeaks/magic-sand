RT @mowers: Thank you, President @realDonaldTrump! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸   Iâ€™m proud to have served in President Trumpâ€™s administration and to have his endorsement to beat Chris Pappas!   What a great night in Londonderry. Awesome to see so much support from across New Hampshire for the President! #nhpolitics https://t.co/N00oP3bmJM
