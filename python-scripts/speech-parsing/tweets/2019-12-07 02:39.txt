RT @RepMattGaetz: NAS Pensacola is a huge source of pride for all of Northwest Florida. It is the home of naval aviation. It is the home of the Blue Angels. In our home, this is who we are.  Thank you for keeping Pensacola in your hearts and in your prayers as we deal with this difficult day. https://t.co/PcvS70GcQh
