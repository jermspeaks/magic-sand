RT @TomCottonAR: More lies from the debunked 1619 Project.   Describing the *views of the Founders* and how they put the evil institution on a path to extinction, a point frequently made by Lincoln, is not endorsing or justifying slavery.  No surprise that the 1619 Project can't get facts right. https://t.co/nLsb73X3Gi
