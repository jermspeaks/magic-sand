RT @PeteHegseth: This Atlantic “story” is nothing but a textbook Leftist hit-job. Always anonymous. Always coordinated. And, as we’ve seen with all the other anti-Trump hoaxes, always fabricated.  The Left knows how @realDonaldTrump defends &amp; revers our vets/military—so they attack his strength. https://t.co/OgVbnxq8gz
