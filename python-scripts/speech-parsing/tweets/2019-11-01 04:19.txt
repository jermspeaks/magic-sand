RT @RepLeeZeldin: Just voted NO on the impeachment inquiry resolution.  Doesn’t ensure minority subpoena power or release of transcripts. Doesn’t equally allocate staffing between parties. Doesn’t allow POTUS’ counsel to be present to question witnesses &amp; present evidence. It’s just a Schiff Show.
