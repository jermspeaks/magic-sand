RT @LLinWood: President Trump @realDonaldTrump is a genuinely good man. He does not really like to fire people. I bet he dislikes putting people in jail, especially “Republicans.”  He gave @BrianKempGA &amp; @GaSecofState every chance to get it right. They refused. They will soon be going to jail. https://t.co/7PMBLc8L2N
