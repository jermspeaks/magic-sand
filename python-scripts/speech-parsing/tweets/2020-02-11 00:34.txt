RT @jonkarl: Cold rain, snow and lots of Trump supporters.  Despite the miserable weather, there are already more people lining up outside the venue of @realDonaldTrump â€˜s rally tonight than you see at most of the events for the Democratic candidates. Some have been out here all night https://t.co/PI1DOFy9ro
