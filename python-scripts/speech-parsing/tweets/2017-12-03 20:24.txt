RT @paulsperry_: Wray needs to clean house. Now we know the politicization even worse than McCabe's ties to McAuliffe/Clinton. It also infected his top investigator PETER STRZOK, who sent texts bashing Trump &amp; praising Hillary during campaign. Strzok led Hillary probe &amp; supervised Trump probe! https://t.co/0y403oeqvX
