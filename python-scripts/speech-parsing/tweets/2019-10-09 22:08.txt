RT @Jim_Jordan: Democrats are so busy “striking while the iron is hot” that they didn’t even have a vote to start their crazy impeachment proceedings!  Or maybe they didn’t want to go on record for the American people.  President Trump is right to call them out for this biased &amp; unfair process.
