RT @realDonaldTrump: The Wacky Do Nothing Attorney General of Michigan, Dana Nessel, is viciously threatening Ford Motor Company for the fact that I inspected a Ventilator plant without a mask. Not their fault, &amp; I did put on a mask. No wonder many auto companies left Michigan, until I came along!
