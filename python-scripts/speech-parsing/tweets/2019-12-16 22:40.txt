RT @RepMattGaetz: This is an impeachment with no crime and with no direct evidence.  Why are @RepAdamSchiff, @RepJerryNadler, and @SpeakerPelosi getting off the hook when they said impeachment had to be bipartisan and that there had to be compelling evidence? This impeachment has neither. https://t.co/PkPkKST76I
