RT @narendramodi: Yet another excellent meeting and talks with my friend @realDonaldTrump.  Relations between India and USA are not merely ties between two governments. Ours is a friendship that is people-driven and people centric.   Our nations are cooperating extensively, which is a great sign. https://t.co/VPA8jdhAtI
