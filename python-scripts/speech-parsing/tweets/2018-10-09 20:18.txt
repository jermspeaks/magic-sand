RT @fema: ⚠️If you're told to evacuate for Hurricane #Michael, don't delay. Leave as soon as possible.   Listen to @FLSERT and local officials for the latest on evacuation orders.   Check your route before leaving, figure out a few places you can go &amp; make sure to take your pets. https://t.co/8LOotd5m1P
