For years you had a President who apologized for America - now you have a President who is standing up for America, and standing up for Pennsylvania. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors &amp; co-workers, and GET OUT &amp; VOTE! Early voting has already begun â€” VOTE! https://t.co/9LtXuWWCRV
