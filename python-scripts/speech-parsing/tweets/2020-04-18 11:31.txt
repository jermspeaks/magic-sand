RT @GOPChairwoman: Democrats are blocking more funding for #PaycheckProtectionProgram that @realDonaldTrump signed into law.  1.7M #smallbiz received an average of $206K in aid to keep workers employed, but the money has run out.  Democrats, help our workers and stop killing American jobs! https://t.co/uaehQ66OEN
