RT @FLOTUS: A great first day in #WY. Met w/ Jackson District @boyscouts at the elk antler arches in town square learning about their conservation efforts w/ Natâ€™l Elk Refuge. Explored Snake River w/ 4th graders seeing lots of natural beauty. @NatlParkService #EveryKidOutdoors #BeBest https://t.co/c86bwKzDUx
