RT @RepMarkMeadows: Reminder, as this tweet points out: what we’ve seen is the Ukrainians weren’t aware aid was being reviewed during the call. It wasn’t until a month later.  So President Trump was “extorting” Ukraine with something they... didn’t know about?  The sham narrative is collapsing. https://t.co/Dk3mBNjkR5
