RT @EricTrump: Spare me? First you have never created a job in your life. Second, our great city has gone to shit under your leadership. Crime is up, the men &amp; women of the NYPD detest you, homelessness is rampant, our streets are dirty and people are leaving our city in record numbers. https://t.co/3Fn1glQJEa
