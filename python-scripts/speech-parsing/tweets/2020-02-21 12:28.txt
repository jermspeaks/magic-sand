RT @JuddPDeere45: .@RichardGrenell is my friend and a tremendous public servant. His appointment by @realDonaldTrump is historic, making him the first openly gay cabinet member in history. His identity is not a qualification anymore than mine is, but it’s quite significant and makes me proud! 🇺🇸🏳️‍🌈 https://t.co/Uq49zTk8D4
