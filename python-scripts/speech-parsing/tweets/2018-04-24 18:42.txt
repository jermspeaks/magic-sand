RT @mike_pence: PROUD to support our friend @VoteMarsha for US Senate representing Tennessee. Marsha Blackburn is a rock-ribbed conservative who has been a champion of President Trumpâ€™s pro-jobs, pro-military, AMERICA FIRST agenda &amp; will be critical ally in the Senate. She has our full support! https://t.co/Qe9eGush8F
