RT @HeyTammyBruce: All night, @realDonaldTrump has been sharp, clear, in charge of the issues. This is a man who ran to be POTUS because he cares about our future &amp; delivered. The swamp cares only about itself. Make no mistake, on 11/3 Trump wins his 2nd term &amp; the reformation continues ðŸ‘ŠðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
