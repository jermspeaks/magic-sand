RT @GeraldoRivera: This is crazy scary. A cabal of unelected bureaucrats-angered &amp; upset that @realDonaldTrump fired their boss-whispered about overthrowing him. Has this ever happened? Why isnâ€™t the mainstream seeing this for what it is. This is malignant arrogance from a man fired for lying. https://t.co/uvtz6tQmEa
