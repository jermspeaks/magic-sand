RT @TomFitton: 4 FBI witness interview reports are “missing”, along with the notes of a meeting between the FBI and the intelligence community about Hilary Clinton’s email server. How does the FBI “lose” key interview notes? It’s either a cover-up or the investigation was a joke. https://t.co/GiPjcMp07v
