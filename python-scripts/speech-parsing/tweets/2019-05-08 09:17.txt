RT @GOPChairwoman: Hillary Clinton is STILL claiming the election was “stolen” from her.   It wasn’t.  She had a failed message and completely wrote off states like mine.  @realDonaldTrump showed up, has delivered big results as president, and he’s going to win again in 2020! https://t.co/8URPy6cbZe
