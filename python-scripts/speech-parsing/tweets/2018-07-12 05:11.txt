RT @realDonaldTrump: What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? Why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europeâ€™s protection, then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025.
