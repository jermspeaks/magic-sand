RT @NotHimNotAtAll: @Michael_Rae @RichardGrenell Ted Lieu is a friend and received donations from Ed Buck. The guy who was bringing in young black man off the street into his apartment and drugged them up with meth. Now he's in jail for at least 2 deaths that took place! Ted's Idea of a trusted friend, TOTAL PERV AND SICKO. https://t.co/Je7Fmpemod
