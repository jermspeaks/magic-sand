RT @AGHamilton29: Absolutely sickening that the Washington Post published this puff piece glorifying a vicious anti-Semite.   Not only did they refuse to actually address her long record of anti-Semitism, but the only mention is paragraph dismissing it by pointing to fringe groups defending her. https://t.co/wc23Yc4Hvy
