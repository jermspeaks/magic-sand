RT @SenJohnKennedy: I think Speaker Pelosi is having 2nd thoughts about impeaching the President. The Senate should get back to work on USMCA &amp; bills on surprise medical billing &amp; lowering the cost of prescription drugs, while Pelosi is trying to figure how to get out of this mess she has created. https://t.co/z7sAKZkXeQ
