RT @RepLeeZeldin: Angry is a big time understatement. Pelosi, Schiff, and Nadler should be stripped of their gavels and the Dems should be removed from power in Nov for their corrupt, rigged, rushed impeachment, hijacking Congress to appease a radical activist liberal base. Angry? Buckle up! https://t.co/pWyIEn8siS
