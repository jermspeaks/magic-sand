- [[Atomic Habits - Highlights]]

### Pre-Read

I’ve read the first part of this book.
- Its thesis is clear: habits are part of our lives, hence are the basis for what we do on a daily basis
- When we understand the mechanisms underlying habits, we can change them
- The atomic part of habits mean the first principles behind habits. This means atomicity is the root habit, or breaking down habits to its elemental features

Thoughts from reading through the front, back, intro, and table of contents
- the word “tiny” comes up, reminding me these ideas are related to [[x/Readwise/Books/Tiny Habits|Tiny Habits]]. 
- as part of [[2025 Year of Capacity]], building good habits and breaking bad ones help in the balance for my own capacity
- Habits have been in the public consciousness for awhile. [[Habits]] showcases ideas around habits, as well as the book, The Power of Habits by Charles’s Duhigg
- the contents of this book is clear: define the framework, explain each step of the framework, and give examples so people can follow along
    - This is a tried and true roadmap that have helped many more books before it. 
- here are some goals based off of the NYTimes review:
    - make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);
    - overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;
    - design your environment to make success easier;
    - get back on track when you fall off course
- here’s the laws:
    1. Make it obvious
    2. Make it attractive
    3. Make it easy
    4. Make it satisfying 
- then it ends with the caveats of habits so you don’t fall in those traps. It includes the Goldilocks rule, the talent myth, automatic behaviors and error correction, and habit maintenance

### Connections

Atomicity
- In design systems, you break down the components into [[Atomic Design]]
- This lends itself to atomic components, which is a form of front end architecture that tries to break things into its smallest components to create compound components that make up areas of a page. Which is kind of contrary to templates, although they can still be useful.
- [[Atomic Notes]] - Andy Matuschak idea of having notes be about one thing, but try to capture the entirety of it. Also, see [[Evergreen notes]]

Context-specific applications
- In [[⛓ Implementing Atomic Habits in IT - Highlights]], we see what those could look like.
